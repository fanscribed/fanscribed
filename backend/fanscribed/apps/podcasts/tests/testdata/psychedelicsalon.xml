A few interesting quotes include: “This nuclear family thing is, I think, part of the root of our problem, that it is an engine for the production of neurotic, dysfunctional people.” . . . and “If guys really got as much sex as they think they want they would probably hand over the machinery of civilization without a fight.”&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/matrixmasters/iGAG/~4/ljkUO_5U0B8" height="1" width="1"/&gt;</description>

      <description>Today we return to the 2013 Palenque Norte Lectures at the Burning Man Festival. Our featured speaker is Dr. George Greer, M.D. who among other things is a co-founder, medical director, and secretary of the Heffter Research Institute, which has been at the forefront of psychedelic research since 1993. In this talk, Dr. Greer explains some mental exercises that have the potential to move your consciousness up a level or so and 'on the natch'. As one of the early researchers into MDMA (Ecstasy), George has some professional insights about the drug, such as: “My thought about MDMA is that it blocks the fear response to a perceived emotional threat.”&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/matrixmasters/iGAG/~4/DtyG_5_7Z8k" height="1" width="1"/&gt;</description>

      <description>One term that he uses in this talk is something that must have been used frequently before, however, I don't remember hearing about “the DEFINING dose” before. Additionally, Terence gives a beautifully word-sculpted description of the increasingly complex layers involved in visual hallucinations. Another interesting comment he made was that he would be signing into the Internet for his first time. Also his somewhat negative view of the Net at that time is quite interesting in light of his highly positive view of the Net just a few years later. Finally, near the end of this talk he tells us what he thinks about reincarnation.&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/matrixmasters/iGAG/~4/9kEGwSey9JI" height="1" width="1"/&gt;</description>

      <description>Today we join Terence McKenna for the final session of a weekend workshop that was held in May of 1990. Here he lets the workshop attendees direct the conversation by asking question, among which are: 1. What does archaic revival mean? 2. Do you think one day psychedelics will be legal and encouraged? 3. Will you talk more about seeing language? 4. Why do you focus so much on visual hallucinations? 5. Who or what do you think these psychedelic entities are? And 6. How do you invoke a conversation with the mushroom? One of my favorite McKenna quotes from this conversation is, “You talk about a well-kept secret that's only two tokes away? How do they keep the lid on this? That's the miracle to me. How do they keep the lid on this?” [smoked NN-DMT]&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/matrixmasters/iGAG/~4/H9M7EBOX7so" height="1" width="1"/&gt;</description>

      <description>“Psilocybin is a pharmacological tool that helps people recognize how it feels to embody the present moment. And that's exactly the same of meditation. It's about bringing yourself into the present moment.”
-Roland Griffiths

In this wide-ranging report on the current state of psychedelic research being conducted at Johns Hopkins Medicine, Dr. Roland Griffiths talks about the work that is being done by a team of researchers who are investigating psychedelic medicines and psychedelic states of consciousness. Dr. Griffiths speaks about their research into the character of one's personality in regards to how a psychedelic experience may affect a person's openness to the experiences of life. Another interesting area that his research group is investigating is the intersection of psilocybin and meditation, a discussion of which takes up a significant part of this talk.&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/matrixmasters/iGAG/~4/rUPxn59vPjs" height="1" width="1"/&gt;</description>

      <description>In a somewhat meandering discourse, Terence reveals (among other things) his thoughts about the possibilities of an afterlife, particularly in light of what he knows about shamanism. He then goes on to give an interesting critique of monotheism, saying, among other things, “It's the monotheistic religions that have to take a real knock for the present situation.” His comments on language and culture include: “Language is something unfinished in us. It is something that was catalyzed out of animal organization by hallucinogenic activation of brain states, and it is something that is in the act of perfecting itself.” . . . “When you go into a culture, you're going to make a choice.

And all cultures represent narrowing of choices.”</itunes:summary><itunes:keywords>consciousness,psychedelic,entheogen,culture,McKenna,LSD,psilocybin,cannabis,marijuana</itunes:keywords><link>http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/matrixmasters/iGAG/~3/uDol8iu5k3k/383-TMcKennaPsyPOV.mp3</link><feedburner:origLink>http://matrixmasters.net/archive/TerenceMcKenna/383-TMcKennaPsyPOV.mp3</feedburner:origLink><enclosure url="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/matrixmasters/iGAG/~5/uDol8iu5k3k/383-TMcKennaPsyPOV.mp3" length="28100000" type="text/audio" /><feedburner:origEnclosureLink>http://matrixmasters.net/archive/TerenceMcKenna/383-TMcKennaPsyPOV.mp3</feedburner:origEnclosureLink></item>

      <description>Once again we join Terence McKenna for a romp through his fascinating mind. While the main thrust of his comments deal with the imagination and the concept of spirituality, he also chases a few eternal questions such as, “What do you think is going on? What do you think this is all about? Who do you think you are? What do you think English is? How do you really cognize notions like the future, the past, where I've been, what I want?” Unfortunately, he doesn't directly answer these questions but rather provides us with a few more analytical tools to help us answer these questions on our own. My favorite quote from this talk is, “And, in fact, the evidence is building that our style of society is the historical equivalent of a temper tantrum.”&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/matrixmasters/iGAG/~4/xY88lbVLtek" height="1" width="1"/&gt;</description>

      <description>This podcast begins a series of talks from a Terence McKenna workshop that was held in May of 1990. In this presentation we hear Terence's introductory remarks at the opening session. Topics touched upon include “Archaic Virtual Reality” and “How Do We Say It Right?”. Two of my favorite quotes from this lecture are: “Outlandish things are going on inside the psychedelic experience. It seems to imply the thing we had hardly dared hope, which is that the world is whatever you say it is if you know how to say it right.” and “Science fiction I really consider a proto-psychedelic drug, because what science fiction does is it gives permission to imagine.”&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/matrixmasters/iGAG/~4/m5b-zwuRl-A" height="1" width="1"/&gt;</description>

      <description>This podcast features Jae Starfox's 2013 Palenque Norte Lecture, which was delivered at the Burning Man Festival. In their talk, Jae provides a candid look into some of the issues that transgender people are faced with as they make their way through a sometimes less than friendly world. As more and more people are beginning to deal with their own gender related issues, this talk provides some little discussed but very important information. Following Jae's talk I play a short segment from my interview on the Joe Rogan podcast in which we also discuss gender issues.&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/matrixmasters/iGAG/~4/M96hawJAJ44" height="1" width="1"/&gt;</description>

      <description>Today we are going to be hearing the final session of a month long workshop that Terence McKenna led in June of 1989. While he again covers a wide range of topics, this is one of his more impassioned talks, and it remains right on point in today's world. One of his more interesting raps is his take on what he calls the priesthood of science and promotes instead a psychedelic point of view, which he defines as: “A psychedelic point of view means a point of view which honors consciousness.” And for those of us who are constantly trying to better understand the cosmos he has these words of wisdom: “You do not measure the depth of a universal mystery with the neural network of a primate. . . . Our role is not to understand but to appreciate.”&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/matrixmasters/iGAG/~4/jzeuKDs_2oI" height="1" width="1"/&gt;</description>

      <description>For anyone under the age of 30, this may be the most important podcast in the salon. Daniel Jabbor is a young entrepreneur and drug policy activist who, among many other accomplishments, and in a very short period of time, founded the now 4,000+ strong Psychedelic Society of San Francisco. Today's podcast features two of Daniel's talks, one from the recent Palenque Norte Lecture Series at the 2013 Burning Man Festival, and another from a psychedelic conference at which he detailed some of the successes of the SSDP, Students for a Sensible Drug Policy. No matter what your age, this is an important message for you to think about. If you know history, you know that quite often it is the young people who are the ones to change its course. These talks by Daniel Jabbor will give you more positive hope for the future than you have had in a long time.&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/matrixmasters/iGAG/~4/b4XHrfAiiaA" height="1" width="1"/&gt;</description>

      <description>In today's lecture, which was given in the summer of 1989, Terence McKenna begins by talking about some of the things that he finds strange about numbers. From there he goes on to tell a few new and funny stories from his adventure at La Chorera. He then goes on to challenge the psychedelic community to take a closer look at itself in regards to if (and if not why not) we have used these medicines to actually become better people. The question he poses is: “Do we embody the radiant correctness of what we say we are pursuing.” He also tells us how he now views the “Sixties”.&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/matrixmasters/iGAG/~4/XVZtwrIfbLs" height="1" width="1"/&gt;</description>

He then goes on to challenge the psychedelic community to take a closer look at itself in regards to if (and if not why not) we have used these medicines to actually become better people. The question he poses is: “Do we embody the radiant correctness of what we say we are pursuing.” He also tells us how he now views the “Sixties”.</itunes:summary><itunes:keywords>consciousness,psychedelic,entheogen,culture,McKenna,LSD,psilocybin,cannabis,marijuana</itunes:keywords><link>http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/matrixmasters/iGAG/~3/XVZtwrIfbLs/374TMcKennaBootstrap.mp3</link><feedburner:origLink>http://matrixmasters.net/archive/TerenceMcKenna/374TMcKennaBootstrap.mp3</feedburner:origLink><enclosure url="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/matrixmasters/iGAG/~5/XVZtwrIfbLs/374TMcKennaBootstrap.mp3" length="32900000" type="text/audio" /><feedburner:origEnclosureLink>http://matrixmasters.net/archive/TerenceMcKenna/374TMcKennaBootstrap.mp3</feedburner:origEnclosureLink></item>

      <description>Continuing with our Terence McKenna workshop we join him in discussion various topics that are raised by the attendees. In one rap he talks about the repugnance of being a slave to an ideology and says,  “And that what we really want, in the domain of planning, is an abandonment of ideology, that ideology is poisonous, all ideology is poisonous.” and then goes on to the importance of being a heretic and says, “You just can't go wrong as a heretic, because they're always vindicated.” and “Permission for heresy is never a bad idea.” Among other topics, Terence also tells us what he originally dreamed of as a career when he was young, along with some of his thoughts about music.&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/matrixmasters/iGAG/~4/fa-5KK7D4s4" height="1" width="1"/&gt;</description>

      <description>Today we again join Terence McKenna in a 1989 workshop where he explores language in the context of the War on Drugs. Some of my favorite quotes from this talk include: “The world is not made of anti-mu mesons, quarks, and photons, and electromagnetic fields. Reality is made of words.” . . . “Culture is more and more consciously becoming a project carried out in the domain of language by, for instance, propaganda both governmental and commercial.” . . . and “Television, introduced at the close of World War II, has become a form of electronic heroin, and it isn't even your trip. They don't even let you go on your own trip, you get a trip designed by Madison Avenue.”&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/matrixmasters/iGAG/~4/asLzzwxRUEY" height="1" width="1"/&gt;</description>

      <description>Today Terence McKenna picks up his inquiry into the concept of time from the standpoint of human history. He points out that, in the overall history of the planet, the sum total of human history is, in the amount of time it has covered, like a lightening strike. Also, he gives a more complete explanation of the workings of the I Ching. My favorite quote from this talk, which I'm not sure I completely understand, is: “We are like coral animals in a vast reef of excreted technological material that is wired for solid state data transfer.”&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/matrixmasters/iGAG/~4/VQIoU0uZEyU" height="1" width="1"/&gt;</description>

Here are a couple of my favorite quotes from this talk: “What 'psychedelic' means is getting your mind out in front of you, by whatever means necessary, so that you can relate to it as a thing in the world and then work upon it.” And one of my all-time favorites, “You've been told from the cradle that the deck was stacked against you, fall of man, original sin, and so forth and so on.

      <description>In this installment of a June 1989 workshop, Terence McKenna adds a few new twists to some of his often-told tales, for example, by comparing a DMT trip to an automobile accident. Also, for the first time that I remember hearing it, he gives a very interesting opinion about where you GO when you smoke DMT. And I'm not talking about where to go in this physical universe, but about 'WHERE' the place is, and WHAT the place is that you seem to be in while you are in the thrall of the experience. He concludes by comparing our current human situation to that of the apes in the movie 2001 who were dancing around the monolith. In our case the monolith is psychedelic substances. All we know right now, he says, is that we've discovered something that may be as important to us as fire.&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/matrixmasters/iGAG/~4/3_v4jdsmO5k" height="1" width="1"/&gt;</description>

      <description>Terence begins by telling us that even as a child he was what we now call psychedelic, and it was then that he decided he would “entertain any idea but believe in nothing”. From there we are treated with a romp through the evolving mind of Terence McKenna, who, as usual, touches on a wide variety of topics in the introduction to a workshop that was held in June of 1989. Some of his thought-provoking comments include: “Nothing is as boundary dissolving, except for psychedelic compounds, as travel. Travel is up there.” . . . “Without an understanding and a familiarity of the psychedelic experience you should be sued for fraud if you're practicing psychotherapy.” . . . “What the psychedelics are for us as a species, rather than for each one of us as an individual, what they are for us as a species is an enzyme that catalyzes the language-making capacity.” . . . And famously: “I have nothing but scorn for all weird ideas other than my own.”&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/matrixmasters/iGAG/~4/mBEZc8QApcc" height="1" width="1"/&gt;</description>

      <description>Today's podcast features the next installment of a 1988 workshop that was let by Terence McKenna. Among other interesting topics he covers here is his take on the drug culture of the 1960s and how the lack of a shamanism model for LSD caused some unforeseen consequences and why what he calls “the first psychedelic revolution” got into trouble. A couple of my favorite sound bites from this conversation include: “And science, when it examines psychedelics, as it will and must, is going to discover a revolution, I believe, that will put all the previous revolutions in perspective.” And, speaking about science, “Nobody should be allowed more than fifty years to get their act together.”&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/matrixmasters/iGAG/~4/ISngWcIZNYY" height="1" width="1"/&gt;</description>

      <description>Today we begin the Q&amp;A session from another Terence McKenna workshop. As usual, the topics covered were quite wide-ranging. Here are a few of my favorite quotes: “What you call man is time.” [Quoting the mushroom.] . . . “What happens with DMT is you leap over all the barriers in the first few seconds. Unlike mushrooms where over hours and hours on a high dose you might navigate yourself to the center of the Mandela, DMT is like being struck by metaphysical lightening.” . . . “History is the siren song of the soul.”&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/matrixmasters/iGAG/~4/repcALc2cfk" height="1" width="1"/&gt;</description>

After telling a little about the Hofmann event, Myron read part of the talk that he gave in Basil.

      <description>Today's podcast features Dr. Timothy Leary reading a few selected chapters from his autobiography, Flashbacks. Interestingly, he begins this recording with Chapter 19, which details with his departure from Harvard. The last chapter that he included on this tape ends with his escape, barely, from prison. Of course, since we now know the rest of the story, the relief he obviously felt after escaping was very short lived. One of his more amusing quotes from this reading is when he called Harvard University a “finishing school for Fortune 500 executives”.&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/matrixmasters/iGAG/~4/4qjysPNOQik" height="1" width="1"/&gt;</description>

This is a fictional account of what was once the most fashionable psychedelic salon on the West Coast. Once each month, for more than eight years, an amazing group of people would gather to discuss a mind-numbing array of topics. And while the story line in my novel is obviously fictional, the backdrop of the salon itself is described as best I can . . . and as best that I now remember, looking back after so many years that have passed since those wondrous meetings of the L.A.

Shonagh is an author, shaman and spell breaker, who takes her students beyond the cultural mass-trance and into the territory of the sacred. In the Pacific Northwest she teaches workshops that are deeply transformative, helping people to release from old behavior patterns and access a wealth of inner resources. She says about herself, “I think of myself as a spiritual warrior, and a spiritual warrior seeks to know, they are on a quest to know.”&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/matrixmasters/iGAG/~4/WgMCd5w22Rk" height="1" width="1"/&gt;</description>

His bottom line on this is to be truthful and avoid hypocrisy. Perhaps the most interesting comment he makes though is when he says what he intends to do on December 22, 2012 if nothing happens. Also there is a fascinating discussion about how and when to tell your children that you are psychedelic.&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/matrixmasters/iGAG/~4/5MmryYMR8bE" height="1" width="1"/&gt;</description>

      <description>We continue today with a workshop led by Terence McKenna in August of 1993. Since the topics covered depended upon the questions that the participants asked, a wide range of subjects is again covered. One interesting side story he touches on is that while he often described parts of DMT visions as containing jeweled Faberge eggs, he admits that he could also have described them in other ways as well. Also, he gives his opinion about both the New Age and so-called modern science. One of my favorite quotes from this talk is: “One of the motivations for my career is to get other people to check [DMT] out, because here is truly confounding data that you don't have to make an expedition to the heart of the Amazon, or battle your way through hours of waves of nausea and dark spaces, chanting your mantra obsessively. I mean, when you smoke DMT, 30 seconds later you're in the presence of the unspeakable, and the show is going full blast.”&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/matrixmasters/iGAG/~4/XwEJttKmL_Q" height="1" width="1"/&gt;</description>

      <description>He gets off to a quick start by speculating about what would happen if we could all create an accurate virtual reality simulation of our psychedelic experiences and then share them with one another. Once he gets really warmed up he takes off on a critique of Christianity that you won't want to miss. Next he expands on the idea that only Islam provides what some people consider to be 'traditional' values. And then, of course, there is the mushroom: “The fungi became, or is for some mysterious reason still to be discovered, a pipeline into a mind, an entelechy, which we can only image as feminine and can only associate somehow to the environment, to the ecosystem. This is the Gaian mind. This is what the goddess really is.

      <description>In today’s podcast we get to hear Terence McKenna questioning himself about his emerging role in our culture, even calling himself “perhaps a dancing bear”. He then goes on to describe, with some incredulity, his performances on stage at various raves. The talk itself is from the opening night of a weekend workshop in during the month of August 1993. A few of my favorite quotes from this talk include: “Not reckless dose but committed dose. Not to see if it works. It works, other people have established that.

He then goes on to describe, with some incredulity, his performances on stage at various raves. The talk itself is from the opening night of a weekend workshop in during the month of August 1993. A few of my favorite quotes from this talk include: “Not reckless dose but committed dose. Not to see if it works. It works, other people have established that. You don't need to do research to confirm that it's psychoactive.” . . . “The truth, for sure, when it arrives, will make you smile.

      <description>Today's podcast features a panel discussion with Annie Oak, Twilight, and Bruce Damer that took place at the 2012 Palenque Norte Lectures held at that year's Burning Man Festival. While this is not a “how to” discussion with specific steps, it is larger in scope in that the panelists and audience exchange thoughts about some of the more important components of a high functioning psychedelic community. At the end of the podcast, Lorenzo explains why he will no longer respond to email coming from accounts that have been spied upon by the government. He then talks about additional security measures our community should be thinking of to protect our personal data from government spies.&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/matrixmasters/iGAG/~4/1wNr85Gs5YE" height="1" width="1"/&gt;</description>

      <description>Today we only go back in time a short way, back to December 12, 2012 when Matt Pallmary and Michael Garfield took a break during their work on the stage production of Matt's novel, “Land Without Evil”, in Austin, Texas. In this wide ranging discussion between salon favorite, Matt Pallamary, and long time saloner, burner, artist, and musician, Michael Garfield, one of my favorite topics was Michael's very positive take on the long-term impact of the work of Terence McKenna, regardless of the fact that the Timewave theory had obviously been disproven. Michael is also a regular performer on the festival circuit, and his schedule may be found online at www.michaelgarfield.net.&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/matrixmasters/iGAG/~4/nWxrCvJSd1c" height="1" width="1"/&gt;</description>

      <description>Today's podcast features the closing session of a workshop that Terence McKenna led in December of 1994. Here is a little sample of some of the topics he covered that Sunday morning: “Chaos is roving through the system and able to undo, at any point, the best laid plans.” . . . “Because the planetary culture is becoming ever more closely knitted together all its parts are becoming co-dependent.” . . . “National governments are under paid, under staffed, and under talented.” . . . “Don't worry. You don't know enough to worry. . . . Who do you think you are that you should worry, for cryin' out loud. It's a total waste of time. It presupposes such a knowledge of the situation that it is, in fact, a form of hubris.”&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/matrixmasters/iGAG/~4/jnoSOBlW8r8" height="1" width="1"/&gt;</description>

      <description>We continue again with a workshop given by Terence McKenna in December of 1994. Some of his interesting comments about psychedelics include: “You see, the amazing thing about psychedelics is it doesn't depend on a state of grace. It doesn't depend on allegiance to a leader. It doesn't even depend on a special diet or theological predilection The astonishing news about these psychedelic experiences is: You don't have to go to India for ten years. You don't have to be chosen by Baba-G. This works for most people, and would probably work for you.” And, “If you think that you've got it all figured out, and you haven't ever had an intense, boundary-dissolving psychedelic, then you're absolutely out to lunch. You don't know what's going on. It's like the opinions of eleven year old boys about sexuality.”&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/matrixmasters/iGAG/~4/Ap4W_IKX6UQ" height="1" width="1"/&gt;</description>

      <description>Today we pick up once again on a workshop that Terence McKenna gave at the end of 1994. Like many of his events, his remarks were driven by questions from those in attendance. One of the most interesting of his riffs is in answer to a question about what the differences were between experiences driven by ayahuasca, by psilocybin, by DMT, and by LSD. Two of my favorite quotes from this talk are: “If you go to Paris you know more about reality than people who don't. If you smoke DMT you know more about reality than people who don't.” And, “In the Newtonian and print-created social space that we're walking around in you are like a self-extracting archive that hasn't self-extracted itself yet. And then you take psilocybin and you self-extract and unfold.”&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/matrixmasters/iGAG/~4/efiveyXA5FA" height="1" width="1"/&gt;</description>

      <description>Today's talk by Hamilton Souther is, in my opinion, the most enlightening presentation about ayahuasca that we have yet heard here in the salon. If you are here for the first time, and are looking for information about ayahuasca, this is a great place to begin. In addition to one of the best descriptions of what takes place in one's mind during an ayahuasca ceremony, Hamilton also provides some excellent advice about journeying in the Amazon: “[When interviewing a shaman] especially look at everybody in the eyes. The eyes in ayahuasca tell you everything. If you see people with eyes that get really glossed over and become really shifty, it's letting you know something there is going on that maybe you don't want to become like that. Maybe that's not why you're there.”&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/matrixmasters/iGAG/~4/asrJDpLTosM" height="1" width="1"/&gt;</description>

      <description>Today we return to the December 1994 workshop given by Terence McKenna. As usual, he covered a wide range of topics. Here is a sampling of his thoughts that morning: “Just because you have a nut theory it doesn't mean that you agree with other nut theories. In fact, it often makes you very hostile to them. After all, there's a limited pool there that we're all after.” . . . “Because I believe psychedelics are a kind of higher dimensional sectioning of reality, I think they give the kind of stereoscopic vision necessary to hold the entire hologram of what's happening in your mind. The old paradigm is gone.” . . . “Shamanism is about shape shifting. Shamanism is about doing phenomenology with a tool kit that works.” . . . “I think psychedelics are sort of like doing calisthenics in preparation for the marathon at the end of time.”&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/matrixmasters/iGAG/~4/6oTSvAcw9k0" height="1" width="1"/&gt;</description>

      <description>Terence McKenna returns once again, this time in some opening remarks during the Friday introduction session of a weekend workshop that was held late in 1994. Early on he says, “Our best efforts are nothing more than half-completed stories told around the campfire. We don't actually know what our predicament is. We are up against a phenomenon which we can barely bring into focus in our cognitive sphere, and it's the phenomenon of our own existence.” . . . and it only gets better from there.&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/matrixmasters/iGAG/~4/SKWIHsbsix8" height="1" width="1"/&gt;</description>

      <description>Today we again travel back in time, almost 30 years, and join Terence McKenna for a few thoughts about transhuman encounters, or, as he likes to call it “alien love”. In case you are thinking that this is just another one of his journeys into the realm of UFOs, abductions, and the like, you may be surprised at the approach to these topics that he takes in this lecture. It isn't only aliens that Terence talks about. He also covers his main beat, psychedelics, and says: “I don't think that mass drug taking is a good idea. But I think that we must have a deputized minority, a shamanic professional class if you will, whose job is to bring ideas out of the deep black water and show them off to the rest of us and perform for our culture some of the cultural functions that shaman perform in pre-literate cultures.” He goes on to say, “You have to take seriously the notion that understanding the universe is your responsibility, because the only understanding of the universe that will be useful to you is your understanding.”&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/matrixmasters/iGAG/~4/IKQMY0E-3HE" height="1" width="1"/&gt;</description>

      <description>In today's podcast we hear once again from Terence McKenna, who proposes that the 20th century appeared to reflect the state of chaos in Europe during the Renaissance only on a global scale this time. He then goes on to relate his views to the Gaian Hypothesis. A few of the ideas he floats in this talk include: “I think there is a global commonality of understanding coming into being. And it is not necessarily fostered by institutions.” . . . “If I had to pick an ontological vision that was compatible with what I think these drugs are about, and with what I think is trying to happen, I would pick Taoism.” . . . “I'm proposing on one level that hallucinogens be thought of as almost as social pheromones that regulate the rate at which language develops, and therefore regulate human culture generally.”&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/matrixmasters/iGAG/~4/PehmpweEkZs" height="1" width="1"/&gt;</description>

In addition to urging (and motivating) artists to follow their dreams, they also give significant practical advice based upon their own experiences, including the ongoing work with COSM. As Alex says, “If it's a psychedelic family business, then you've got to consider the 'top line' [as contrasted with 'the bottom line']. What's the top line? The top line is: You have one unique life, and what do you love to do? What do you want to spend your life doing?

      <description>Today's talk features Dennis McKenna in a June 1984 presentation of his research concerning ayahuasca. This is one of the first, if not the first, public presentation of Dennis' early work involving this sacred medicine. For most of the last 33 years, ayahuasca has been one of the major preoccupations of his professional life, and he is considered one of the world's leading scientific experts in this field. As Dennis says in a recent article in The Journal of Psychoactive Drugs: “In that time, I have written extensively on the botany, chemistry, and pharmacology of ayahuasca, on its potential therapeutic uses, and on the need for more, and more rigorous, scientific and clinical investigations of this remarkable plant decoction. Working with colleagues such as Dr. Grob, my good friends Jace Callaway and Dr. Luis Eduardo Luna in Finland, my mentor Dr. Neil Towers, my late and beloved brother Terence, Dr. Glaucus de Souza Brito, and others, to investigate the myriad mysteries of ayahuasca, has been as rich and rewarding an experience as any scientist could ever hope for.”&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/matrixmasters/iGAG/~4/hyuQbfhbMOA" height="1" width="1"/&gt;</description>

      <description>Today I'm going to play a little audio collage of Terence McKenna that comes from a radio interview and one other recording. Some of my favorite Terence quotes from this program are: “I think it's the sheer power of the hallucinogens that puts people off. You either love them or you hate them, and that's because they dissolve world views. And if you like the experience of having your entire ontological structure disappear out from under you, if you think that's a thrill, you'll probably love psychedelics.” . . . and . . . “We can no longer have forbidden areas of the human mind, or cultural machinery.

Some of my favorite Terence quotes from this program are: “I think it's the sheer power of the hallucinogens that puts people off. You either love them or you hate them, and that's because they dissolve world views. And if you like the experience of having your entire ontological structure disappear out from under you, if you think that's a thrill, you'll probably love psychedelics.” . . . and . . . “We can no longer have forbidden areas of the human mind, or cultural machinery. We have taken upon ourselves the acquisition of so much power that we now must understand what we are. We cannot travel much further with the definitions of man that we inherit from the Judeo-Christian tradition.

      <description>In this, my last podcast of 2012, I thought it would be fun to hear a little more from Terence McKenna. As always, there is always something new to think about after listening to one of his lectures. Here are just two brief quotes from this talk: “And the whole schtick of the psychedelic experience, I think, is reclaim immediate experience, realize that you out vote all parliaments, police forces, and major newspapers on the planet because, who knows, they may be illusions.” . . . “The world could be anything, you know, It could be a solid state matrix of some sort.

      <description>Since today (the day I'm recording and posting this podcast) is the 2012 Winter Solstice, I'm going to feature my friend Daniel Pinchbeck as our guest speaker. As you know, Daniel wrote a book titled “2012: The Return of Quetzalcoatl”, also, he is widely known as a speaker and writer about many things psychedelic and esoteric. However, I know him best as a fellow alumnus of the Entheobotany Seminars at Palenque, where Terence McKenna and his merry band of psychonauts would hold forth each January. In this talk, one that he gave at the Palenque Norte lectures during this year's Burning Man festival, Daniel follows the format of other psychedelic luminaries and lets the audience guide the direction of the lecture through their questions. Among other topics that Daniel covers are  2012, consciousness, the Occupy Movement, and possibilities for the future.&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/matrixmasters/iGAG/~4/AHR7zKyKHPw" height="1" width="1"/&gt;</description>

      <description>Today's podcast features a talk given by Terence McKenna at the legendary Megatripolis Club in London during the Summer of 1994. He is introduced to a somewhat raucous crowd by the proprietor of the club, Fraser Clark. In this wide-ranging talk, McKenna begins by saying, “The smart people who are straight are involved in simply the media management of what has turned into a slow apocalypse, spreading starvation, exacerbated class differences, toxified agriculture, so forth and so on. I don't believe the Establishment thinks there are solutions. Their policy is basically the management of panic, which is hardly a forward moving approach to the adventure of human civilization.” Later, as only Terence could, he cries out, “Let's not underrate cannabis, for cryin' out loud. Cannabis should be the glue of the community!”&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/matrixmasters/iGAG/~4/RLxQ2xbeKa4" height="1" width="1"/&gt;</description>

Brian, who has been a community organizer for MAPS and other organizations, is also expert on the cacao plant. Originally, Brian titled this talk “The Entheobotany of Cacao”, however, I decided to change the title to better reflect the wide-ranging discussion of a little-understood, but extremely important, plant. This is about significantly more than chocolate. Following Brian's talk I play a short segment about the work of Occupy Sandy and close with a song sent in from some fellow saloners, The Chooks, it is simply titled “Occupy” and is freely available for download via PsychedelicSalon.us.&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/matrixmasters/iGAG/~4/WA3a3CyPjr8" height="1" width="1"/&gt;</description>

This talk is by author, lecturer, and drug war authority, Charles Shaw, who learned the truth about the War on Drugs from the people who are most being oppressed by this war. As he says, “For the lower classes, the poorer classes, which generally in this country are people of color, drug laws have always been used as a way to control them.” And he goes on to say, “But what they're trying to stop more than anything is ideas.  Because what it is is a war of ideas. . . . It's no secret that psychedelics change consciousness. It's no secret that they're revolutionary. . . . The true revolutionary leaders, I think, are going to be the ones who figure out how to not go in the street and how to disseminate the revolution by other means.”&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/matrixmasters/iGAG/~4/wkQ3r3CZ5YQ" height="1" width="1"/&gt;</description>

As you can see, I have re-titled the talk “Understanding the Default Process of Consciousness” to better fit with some of his closing remarks which included: “If you understand the default process of your consciousness, and you work with that default process and start to pay attention to that process, then you can actually start to manipulate the process, just like you can manipulate any process that you understand.”&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/matrixmasters/iGAG/~4/2ebJuyFhkGA" height="1" width="1"/&gt;</description>

      <description>Today we feature the second of the 2012 Palenque Norte Lectures at the Burning Man Festival. The talk was given by Dr. Michelle (Maddy) Corbin whose doctoral dissertation is titled “Spirituality in the laboratory:  Negotiating the politics of knowledge in the psychedelic sciences”. Among her many insightful observations is this interesting thought: “And because it came through a chemical that allowed them to study it, they began to engage with spirituality in a way that was historically unprecedented. I argue that [psychedelics] are a doorway through which spirituality entered the scientific laboratory in a way that it usually doesn't.”&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/matrixmasters/iGAG/~4/GHsTdev9m1k" height="1" width="1"/&gt;</description>

After an introduction to the series by Bruce Damer we feature the extraordinary visionary artist Amanda Sage. While her talk follows the exciting path that her life has taken, it is also a remarkable word-painting of a future that has already begun, particularly among the world wide artistic and dance communities. This is one of the most hopeful and forward-looking presentations yet to be featured in the salon.&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/matrixmasters/iGAG/~4/vyqV2Rpusrk" height="1" width="1"/&gt;</description>

If we want to experiment with our consciousness we should be able to gain good and reliable information easily. Instead it's very difficult. We have to go underground. We have to stay out of the mainstream if we want to learn about ayahuasca.” And, “What ayahuasca does is to allow us to make accessible to our senses areas of reality that are normally off limits to us. I believe that those are real, not fiction of the brain.

      <description>Today's podcast features a talk given by Jonathan Talat Phillips in Vancouver sometime earlier this year. In it, Jonathan tells the story of how, after a devastating loss as counter cultural activist, he embarked on a mystical initiation involving underground ayahuasca ceremonies, kundalini awakenings, DMT cowboys, shapeshifting extraterrestrials at Burning Man, miraculous healings, and an international movement trailblazing visionary ways to help our planet in crisis. Along the way he uncovers the lost rites of the Christian mystery schools and secret “electric” messages for personal and global transformation. . . . Jonathan is the author of “The Electric Jesus: The Healing Journey of a Contemporary Gnostic.” He co-founded the cutting edge web-magazine Reality Sandwich and The Evolver Network, coordinating 40+ regional Evolver communities. He is a religion blogger for "The Huffington Post," the creator of “The Ayahuasca Monologues: Tales of the Spirit Vine,” a Reiki Master and Bioenergetic Healer.&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/matrixmasters/iGAG/~4/7KVsJdTSwZU" height="1" width="1"/&gt;</description>

      <description>Today's program consists of ten separate pieces from a June 2012 workshop at the Esalen Institute, eight of which are by Bruce Damer. Here are the titles that Bruce has given to these short talks:
  --Are we all becoming autistic astronauts? 
  --On our dual bonobo and chimp nature 
  --The things I loved about Terence 
  --Esalen @ 50 
  --"Procreate only once" (and we will have a future) 
  --The wellspring of human consciousness 
  --Terence's greatest Rap: Its all about Love, and where to now, Butterfly Hunter? 
Following that we will be hearing the two closing segments of the workshop. The first is the “Rap for Terence” by Earth Girl and following that comes Galen Brandt singing her tribute to Terence titled “Aho Terence floating in the sky”.&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/matrixmasters/iGAG/~4/_YhunuWsAaQ" height="1" width="1"/&gt;</description>

The majority of this program features comments by some of the workshop's participants who bring up topics that include: Heroic doses; Body load with psychedelics; Techniques for using psychedelics; What exactly is the psychedelic state; The perfect answer when a cop asks, “Were are you at, buddy?”; The re-introduction of psychedelics to our species; How do we tell the psychedelic story; The Occupy Movement and the banking system; The need for a parallel system of money&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/matrixmasters/iGAG/~4/amMtxDIJyuw" height="1" width="1"/&gt;</description>

      <description>Today's podcast features the next installment of the workshop that Bruce Damer and I led at the Esalen Institute near Big Sur, California in mid-June 2012. This segment contains the commentary from participants in the workshop immediately after the “Deep Dive into the Mind of McKenna” that was featured in Podcast 316 and which has been temporarily removed from the Net. While the title of this talk may indicate that it is another podcast about the Occupy Movement, but that isn't actually the case, although the movement is referred to in part.&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/matrixmasters/iGAG/~4/DFILmwZVbtQ" height="1" width="1"/&gt;</description>

      <description>This is the second tape in the Paul Herbert Collection of the words of Terence McKenna, and as far as I can tell, it hasn't been posted on the Net before. The title of the talk as shown on the cassette tape from which it came is “Psilocygin and the Sands of Time”, however, that first word may be a misspelling of the word 'psilocybin'. The recording was made in December of 1982 and the event was a “SEN Interview” at the Esalen Institute near Big Sur, California. Like most McKenna talks, this one is also packed full of interesting ideas, such as: “On these matters of specific fact, like is the mushroom an extraterrestrial and that sort of thing, I haven't the faintest idea. The mushroom itself is such a mercurial, elusive, Zen sort of personality that I never believe a word it says. I simply entertain its notions and try and sort through them, and I found that to be the most enriching approach to it.”&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/matrixmasters/iGAG/~4/wqTHrL2g1mE" height="1" width="1"/&gt;</description>

      <description>This is the first of what I am calling the Paul Herbert Collection of the words of Terence McKenna. The tape's label reads: “Terence McKenna: NEW AND OLD MAPS OF HYPERSPACE ISC Lecture November 1982 Berkeley.” The complete collection consists of over 160 high quality recordings of Terence McKenna lectures that were recorded by Paul Herbert. Over the course of the next few years I will be podcasting this entire collection in the order in which they were recorded. This means that there will be a few McKenna lectures that will be repeated here in the salon, as a few of them had already been available in many places. However, there is a good deal of new material here, and over the next two years I suspect we will hear many new gems from the lips of the bard McKenna.&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/matrixmasters/iGAG/~4/98kTT3yhm4M" height="1" width="1"/&gt;</description>

      <description>Today we pick up where we left off in my previous podcast with the good Doctor Timothy Leary holding forth in a very small group setting somewhere in Germany. As near as I can tell, this private salon was held sometime in 1983. One of the comments he makes in this talk is he thinks that each generation born after World War II may actually be an entirely new species of human. And while this may sound quite radical, particularly when you consider that he made this comment in 1983, there is a recent TED talk by Juan Enriquez titled “Will our kids be a different species?” I have linked to it in the program notes for this podcast and highly recommend that you give it a listen as well.&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/matrixmasters/iGAG/~4/exfwrKcK-SU" height="1" width="1"/&gt;</description>

      <description>Today's podcast features another recording from the Dr. Timothy Leary archive. As best I can tell, it was recorded at a small salon somewhere in Germany in 1983 or so. As is often the case with Dr. Leary, a wide variety of topics was covered in a relatively short time. The notation on the tape from which this talk came listed the following topics as being included (to one degree or another): Humor; John Lilly; HANDS ON; Turn on, drop out &amp; take over; Stage 12; Bodymanagement; Self reliance, Purpose of Life. And in one way or another he managed to squeeze them all in to a single hour of recording.&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/matrixmasters/iGAG/~4/RFGk_y3Tyxk" height="1" width="1"/&gt;</description>

      <description>Today's podcast features one of the most important lectures that I have played here in the salon. It is a talk that Dr. Eben Moglan gave on May 22, 2012 at the Freedom to Connect conference. In this talk Dr. Moglen very clearly describes the imminent threat that governments and large corporations pose to not only our freedom to use the Internet as we choose, but to the further evolution of human consciousness itself. As he says in this talk, “The Network, as it stands now, is an extraordinary platform for enhanced social control. Very rapidly, and with no apparent remorse, the two largest governments on Earth, that of the United States of America and the People's Republic of China, have adopted essentially the identical points of view. A robust social graph connecting government to everybody, and the exhaustive date mining of society, is both governments' fundamental policy with respect to their different forms of what they both refer to, or think of, as 'stability maintenance'. . . . We need, 'we' who understand what is happening, need to be very vocal about that.”&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/matrixmasters/iGAG/~4/4tOQyDjJo0M" height="1" width="1"/&gt;</description>

We need, 'we' who understand what is happening, need to be very vocal about that.”</itunes:summary><itunes:keywords>consciousness,psychedelic,entheogen,culture,McKenna,LSD,psilocybin,cannabis,marijuana</itunes:keywords><link>http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/matrixmasters/iGAG/~3/4tOQyDjJo0M/312-MoglenNetFreedom.mp3</link><feedburner:origLink>http://matrixmasters.net/archive/Various/312-MoglenNetFreedom.mp3</feedburner:origLink><enclosure url="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/matrixmasters/iGAG/~5/4tOQyDjJo0M/312-MoglenNetFreedom.mp3" length="34700000" type="text/audio" /><feedburner:origEnclosureLink>http://matrixmasters.net/archive/Various/312-MoglenNetFreedom.mp3</feedburner:origEnclosureLink></item>

      <description>Today I'm playing a recording of a talk that I gave in March of 2001 at The Inside Edge, a Southern California association of cultural creatives. The topic was some of the themes in my book, “The Spirit of the Internet: Speculations on the Evolution of Global Consciousness”. One of the more controversial aspects of this talk is my comparison of a deep Internet experience with a psychedelic experience. . . . Also included in this podcast is some discussion of the growing student strike in Quebec and the mounting student loan debt bubble here in the U.S.&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/matrixmasters/iGAG/~4/tdL-rIPg8VE" height="1" width="1"/&gt;</description>

      <description>At long last I am finally getting around to podcasting the first session of the Valley of Novelty workshop that Terence McKenna led at Omega Institute in upstate New York on the evening of July 31, 1998. I posted the rest of this workshop several years ago, beginning in podcast 027. In today's program you will hear how Terence often began his workshops, by going around the circle and letting the attendees say a little something. And sometimes Terence would jump in and comment on what they had just brought up. Unfortunately, most of the comments by the attendees wasn't picked up by the single microphone in the front of the room. So I deleted any sections of seeming quiet but left in any comments that Terence made, including his opening and closing remarks.&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/matrixmasters/iGAG/~4/aLrX2PdT9qw" height="1" width="1"/&gt;</description>

      <description>This program includes the end of the Terence McKenna lecture that we were listening to in the previous podcast. And that is followed by a question and answer session, which ends with Terence giving one of the most impassioned pleas for psychonaughts to “come out of the closet” that I have ever heard him (or anyone else) give. . . . And a couple of interesting Terence McKenna quotes from this podcast include: “Anyone who loves adventure, and who loves life, and who loves the experience of being, has an obligation, I think, to explore this [the psychedelic realm]. It's as much a part of your identity as your sexuality, your ancestral history, or your hopes and fears. And to ignore it is to choose to play with less than a full deck. Don't do that. Play with a full deck!” . . . and “People didn't care for the Holocaust, that was a moral outrage, but the policies of the Roman Catholic Church push more people into early death, disease, and poverty than the Holocaust ever did. And yet, they're perfectly free to run their bingo games and appear among us. Why? They should have to answer for this outrage.”&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/matrixmasters/iGAG/~4/mh2p86y1t34" height="1" width="1"/&gt;</description>

      <description>Today's program features the first part of a two hour lecture given by Terence McKenna in early February, 1994. The official title of this talk is “Speaking the Unspeakable”, however, after listening to the first part of it I decided to change the title to something that seemed, to me, more appropriate. A few of my favorite quotes from this talk include: “The contradiction that history confronts us with is a deeper exploration of the psychedelic experience. And the psychedelic experience is something incredibly alien to the Western mind. It is, in fact, taboo.” . . . “The psychedelic experience is not built in to your biology the way orgasm, or sleep, or hunger, or something like that is. It's a physiological option that involves forming a symbiotic relationship with a plant.” . . . “Science has steered us deeply into the notion that nature is soulless and spiritless. And the practice of this idea has led us to the brink of catastrophe, global and species and ecological catastrophe.” . . . “Psychedelics are catalysts for the human imagination. That very simply is what they are.”&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/matrixmasters/iGAG/~4/mE_rohuSyjk" height="1" width="1"/&gt;</description>

The conversations took place in June of 1992 while they were attending a conference in Prague. After first discussing a few of the more esoteric aspects of the psychedelic experience, Ram Das and Terence reminisce about the Sixties and why their vision may not have succeeded. Among the interesting quotes are where Ram Das, speaking of the Sixties, said, “The fact that they noticed us was because we were busy making statements, instead of just being it.” Later, Terence McKenna says, “To me, the most amazing the most amazing transformation in my lifetime is not the revolution of the Sixties but the counter revolution of the Seventies, where they managed to put the cuckoo clock back together again.”&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/matrixmasters/iGAG/~4/n8BMFuD_r40" height="1" width="1"/&gt;</description>

      <description>In this, the concluding episode of recordings from the workshop titled “Terence McKenna: Beyond 2012” and led by Bruce Damer and Lorenzo, we hear Bruce's final presentation in which he begins by taking us on a mental voyage around our solar system. From there he tells a fascinating story of his meeting with a somewhat dodgy character who convincingly explained that, although it may appear that way at times, there actually is no cabal secretly controlling human affairs. Following that begins an interesting Q &amp; A session. . . . In the Occupy segment of the podcast I ponder over the pros and cons of the Black Bloc tactics that have become somewhat controversial lately.&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/matrixmasters/iGAG/~4/7Wi45daBpy0" height="1" width="1"/&gt;</description>

      <description>In today's podcast we pick up with the next part of a workshop that was held on January 28, 2012 titled “Terence McKenna: Beyond 2012”. This section features Bruce Damer, who begins with his “Ode to Terence” and follows with a wide-ranging question and answer session. In the Occupy segment I begin with a recap of what went down in Washington, D.C. the day of the eviction from McPherson Square. The voice you'll hear is that of Nate, who streams a live video feed on Ustream.tv that is called OccupyAir, and this is his recap of the day's events. Also, I play a series of short audio clips. The first one is of a young man from San Diego who was speaking at the General Assembly that was held in the middle of K Street in Washington the evening after the McPhearson eviction. Following him is a bit about the Department of Homeland Security, which now includes a national secret police force, in case you missed that announcement, and we now learn that the DHS is now monitoring journalists and bloggers in a blatant attempt to keep the press away from the occupy actions. Next up is part of an interview with journalist Chris Hedges, who you've heard from on several occasions here in these podcasts already. In this clip Chris will be talking about some of the ideas he put forth in his book, “Empire of Illusion”. And while this segment also ends with a call to the barricades from Chris Hedges in different interview, between those two Hedges segments I play a three minute pep talk that Tony Benn gave to some of the occupiers in London the other day.&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/matrixmasters/iGAG/~4/mFUGY8CHFbY" height="1" width="1"/&gt;</description>

      <description>This is the first in a series of three podcasts that will feature the presentations by Bruce Damer and Lorenzo at the January 28, 2012 workshop, which was held in the Los Angeles area. Today's segment includes Lorenzo's opening talk and comments from the attendees as well as a few remarks by Bruce. Following that part of the podcast is the Occupy Movement update, which features a conversation between Lawrence Lessig and Chris Hedges. During the course of their conversation they debate the relative merits of pushing for a Constitutional Convention verses non-violent civil disobedience. Also included is a sound bite from one of OccupyFreedomLA's live video feeds in which a speaker addresses the actions now being taken by those who are suffering from the foreclosure epidemic that is facing so many people in the U.S.&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/matrixmasters/iGAG/~4/RK-4xuvEW4I" height="1" width="1"/&gt;</description>

      <description>The featured audio that I'm going to play in this podcast is part of a two-CD collection produced by Joe Matheny and given to the salon to podcast by the distributor, The Original Falcon Press, which you can find via originalfalcon.com. There isn't time to hear the entire collection, which is titled “Robert Anton Wilson Remembered”, but I've selected a representative sampling that I think gives a really well-rounded picture of this incredible mind as well as giving us a better idea of the wonderful person that his friends called Bob and the rest of us called RAW. The voices you will here are of:

Douglas Rushkoff
Antero Alli
Tiffany Lee Brown – don't know where she stands on OWS, but her talk sounds right out of the movement to me
Tiffany is followed by
David Jay Brown author of the “Mavericks of the Mind” and “Mavericks of Medicine” books
and the closing comments are by the producer and friend of the salon
Joseph Matheny

For the Occupy Segment, I first play a few minutes that I've taken from a three hour interview that Chris Hedges gave on CSPAN 2 on the first day of this year, and in it you will hear this Pulitzer Prize winning journalist explain how corporate personhood isn't just a threat to American Democracy, it is a threat to humanity itself. . . . Following that, I play a short speech for you that Senator Bernie Sanders gave on the Senate floor as he introduced an amendment to the U.S. Constitution that will strip personhood from corporations. After those two kind of heavy duty pieces. I lighten it up with a two minute clip of country music star Willie Nelson and his wife reading a poem that he wrote about the Occupy Movement. Finally, I close with a song that was written and is sung by a young man from Salt Lake City named Noel. And this is from a YouTube video I found where Noel was singing on Day 1 of the Occupy Salt Lake City street theater&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/matrixmasters/iGAG/~4/ySFEpPR4OzM" height="1" width="1"/&gt;</description>

      <description>Today's podcast is a continuation of the lecture that I played in the podcast just previous to this one. And at one point in this talk, Terence McKenna says, “Let those who talk to the elves find each other and band together.” While that would be a great segue into another Occupy Movement podcast, I'm instead going to do just the opposite. Originally, I planned on splitting the talk I'm about to play into two more segments, each followed by another Occupy update. But after previewing it, I decided that it would be best to just play the remainder of this talk that Terence McKenna gave sometime in 1993, and I think he gave it on several occasions which most likely each differ slightly in content, but he called this series of lectures “The World and Its Double”. Here are a few Terence McKenna quotes from this lecture: “There are old psychedelicists and bold psychedelicists, but there are no old, bold psychedelicists.” … “[DMT] is a secret of such magnitude that it's inconceivable how it has ever been kept.” … and “We all want our children to be well-adjusted, unfortunately there is nothing to be well-adjusted too. So that's a real problem.”&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/matrixmasters/iGAG/~4/RKEX6B48dsQ" height="1" width="1"/&gt;</description>

      <description>The first part of today's podcast features Part 1 of a Terence McKenna talk that may have been given sometime in 1993. Interestingly, he makes a few statements that almost sound as if he is speaking about the Occupy Movement where he says, “We're literally at the end of our rope. Reason and science and the practice of unbridled capitalism have not delivered us into an angelic realm,” and “Boundary dissolution is the most threatening activity that can go on in a society. People, meaning government institutions, become very nervous when people begin to talk to each other.” … In the second half of this podcast I play an audio collage of happenings from the Occupy Movement. They include, a message from my friend Queer Ninja who is with Occupy Scotland. Then I've included a bit by Noam Chomsky,  remarks from various Occupiers talking about the youth involvement and leadership of this movement, and they are followed by some farmers who are also involved. Next is a clip dealing with the civil justice aspects of what is going on, followed by a clip from the Occupy Boston group. Then comes Tina Dupuy who is a columnist and commentator and who points out how the Occupy Movement is changing the shape of local news stories as well as some things about student debt that you maybe haven't thought about. And to close it out you'll be hearing about one of the successful OccupyOurHomes actions where the home of a disabled Iraq vet was saved by the Occupy Atlanta people, and that segment ends with some words by the Rev. Dr. Joseph Lawery, and he is followed by the poet Teresa B., who is the neighbor of another family whose home was also saved by members of the Occupy Movement in New York.&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/matrixmasters/iGAG/~4/Ifm3Cp21UIo" height="1" width="1"/&gt;</description>

      <description>When I previewed this recording of a talk by Hakim Bey, author of “The Temporary Autonomous Zone (TAZ)” a couple of days ago, I was struck at how timely these ideas are right now. Although this talk was recorded in 1993, when Bey speaks about the power of art and that we as the audience must now become our own artists, well, he could have been speaking at a recent GA somewhere near you last night. It seems that the sentiments of the Occupy Movement have been bubbling just under the radar of the Establishment for a long time now. … and wait until you hear him shout, “Democratic Shamanism or Nothing!” … not to mention the part where he said that even if you are in a quilting bee you should be prepared to run guns and stage orgies. … and then he goes on to urge us to become “pirate utopians for peace” “guerillas of harmony”. Also, I have included a brief 1997 recording of Robert Anton Wilson who seems to be predicting the Occupy Movement.&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/matrixmasters/iGAG/~4/e2t4vDkwcA4" height="1" width="1"/&gt;</description>

      <description>Although I missed the beginning of this online meeting, from watching and listening to it, what appears to have taken place is that someone set up a big screen television in a room somewhere near Zuccotti Park and invited some of the people who were the first Occupiers of the park to have a video Skype chat with Makana. And as you'll hear, most of them had not yet even had a chance to hear his powerful song, the one that I played a couple of podcasts ago. Basically, here were five or six people just in from the front lines, and they were meeting with Makana for the first time. Here are a couple of things that Makana had to say, “This whole war that we're fighting is a war of consciousness verses ignorance, of controlling human behavior by controlling people's thoughts, by directing their awareness.” … “The only way we can bring about a revolution of freedom is to bring about a revolution of perception.” … Also I have included the brief talk that Deepak Chopra gave at the Occupy Los Angeles site a few days before it was overrun by the mayor's storm troopers.&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/matrixmasters/iGAG/~4/BYwU5NZIAJ0" height="1" width="1"/&gt;</description>

      <description>Today's talk is part two of the Robert Anton Wilson lecture given in a Santa Cruz, California book store sometime in 1990. He begins with the legend of the statues of the Black Virgin and then goes into more detail about the 
Priory of Sion, the Vatican Bank and several other fascinating topics including how the CIA and the Mafia first got into bed together. One of my favorite quotes from this talk seems as if it came right from an Occupy Wall Street discussion. He said, “The only prediction I'll make is that everything is going to happen faster than we expect it.” … And in my Occupy Wall Street segment I feature the work of a phenomenal journalist by the name of Tim Pool who has been bringing live video feeds and wonderful commentary since day one. Also, I've included sound bites from Captain Raw Lewis of the Philadelphia police department and who was arrested while demonstrating as part of Occupy Wall Street. One of the closing segments is a brief interview with 80 year old Daniel Ellsberg, who was planning on spending the night in a tent at the Occupy Berkeley demonstration.&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/matrixmasters/iGAG/~4/cEjKMci3VFs" height="1" width="1"/&gt;</description>

      <description>For today's program I play the first half of a Robert Anton Wilson talk that was given without notes at a book store in Santa Cruz in 1990. The appearance was organized and recorded by our latest salon benefactor, Joe Matheny who along with The Original Falcon Press, who you can find at OriginalFalcon.com, have given me permission to play these Bob Wilson recordings even though they are currently selling them online as well. And while there is talk of the Illuminati, he brings things more current when he says, “And as a matter of fact, governments don't act, governments only react. The bankers make the decisions, and then governments decide how are we going to adjust to this. Government can't do anything unless the bank gives them the money to do it.” Following RAW's talk I continue with my regular commentary on the Occupy Movement, including sound bites from Occupy Oakland, Occupy Berkeley, and Occupy Portland. If you don't have time to listen to all of this podcast, be sure to at least not miss the last ten minutes of this podcast which features the amazing story of Makana the Mighty.&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/matrixmasters/iGAG/~4/zDn3zPeTunQ" height="1" width="1"/&gt;</description>

      <description>I'm not really sure how to introduce this talk, which actually is a series of eight short vignettes about a wide range of topics. For example, who but Bob Wilson would be able to combine the idea of remaking the King Kong movie but staring Rush Limbaugh as King Kong and Hillary Clinton in Fay Ray's part, to combine that with a very novel idea of how popes are really elected is, to me, a wonderful stroke of genius. Some of RAWs other topics include his “Jumping Jesus Phenomenon”, and a very unique conjecture about the way Popes get elected. All-in-all it's a wonderful view of the genius of Robert Anton Wilson.

In the second half of the podcast, I continue with my Occupy commentary as of Day 53 of OWS. And this segment includes interesting talks by Michael Ruppert and Bill Moyers.&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/matrixmasters/iGAG/~4/ff1FXyEkQ_I" height="1" width="1"/&gt;</description>

      <description>Today's podcast comes in two parts. First comes the question and answer session with Terence McKenna in which he not only makes statements such as, “Acid heads are in charge of designing the cutting edge of culture,” but also makes a statement about our responsibility to the future that sounds almost as if he was talking about Occupy Wall Street, which is the focus of the second part of this podcast. In addition to some of my own thoughts about the Occupy Movement, I also play several sound bites that I've recorded during the past week from various live video streams. The last clip that I play is the rousing talk given by Michael Moore at a recent Occupy San Francisco demonstration.&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/matrixmasters/iGAG/~4/qGlJDU13y5Q" height="1" width="1"/&gt;</description>

The last clip that I play is the rousing talk given by Michael Moore at a recent Occupy San Francisco demonstration.</itunes:summary><itunes:keywords>consciousness,psychedelic,entheogen,culture,McKenna,LSD,psilocybin,cannabis,marijuana</itunes:keywords><link>http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/matrixmasters/iGAG/~3/qGlJDU13y5Q/288-McKennaGreatMonkeyPt2.mp3</link><feedburner:origLink>http://matrixmasters.net/archive/TerenceMcKenna/288-McKennaGreatMonkeyPt2.mp3</feedburner:origLink><enclosure url="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/matrixmasters/iGAG/~5/qGlJDU13y5Q/288-McKennaGreatMonkeyPt2.mp3" length="45600000" type="text/audio" /><feedburner:origEnclosureLink>http://matrixmasters.net/archive/TerenceMcKenna/288-McKennaGreatMonkeyPt2.mp3</feedburner:origEnclosureLink></item>

      <description>Today I'm beginning a slightly different format, the change being that after the lecture or interview, instead of adding my own comments about the talk, I will be covering various aspects of the Occupy movements now taking place all around the planet. … So today the talk is once again by Terence McKenna and is from sometime in 1987 when he was still fine tuning some of his ideas about the monkey and the mushroom. And even though I feel as if I've heard the monkey and the mushroom story too many times already, once again this version adds even more scientific detail to the story than I remember hearing before. … After the lecture by McKenna I talk about what went down at Occupy Oakland recently, and I play an interview from the Occupy Wall Street location with Chris Hedges as well as an interview with a young homeless man at Occupy Atlanta. To end the program I play “Homeless Land 9” by one of our fellow saloners,  John Tackett.&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/matrixmasters/iGAG/~4/rJ2_8YYO0L8" height="1" width="1"/&gt;</description>

      <description>This concludes the three part series of podcasts that include the entire Dr. Timothy Leary interview on KPFT in Houston, Texas on November 13, 1976, not long after Dr. Leary was released from prison. One of his many interesting comments in this part was, “There's perhaps less than ten percent of the population who should even consider, under the best circumstances of disciplined control, to take this drug, because LSD is not a hedonistic, laid-back, multi-orgasm drug. It really isn't. It's a neurological experience. It's a sixth circuit neuroelectric experience, and it's basically preparation for post-terrestrial life.” Also, Leary makes a very interesting point about President Kennedy attempting to turn the solution to a bad economy away from war and into space. Finally, I make my third comment about the Occupy demonstrations now taking place all over the world.&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/matrixmasters/iGAG/~4/9_6Xp4jBlRM" height="1" width="1"/&gt;</description>

      <description>Today we continue with Part 2 of the interview that Dr. Timothy Leary gave on KPFT radio in Houston, Texas on November 13, 1976, just a few months after he was released from prison. We resume the interview at the point where Dr. Leary was defending his own sanity, but soon they move on to a preliminary discussion of Leary's 8-Circuit theories. Two of my favorite quotes from this interview are: “By and large I'm very proud of what happened in the Sixties, every aspect of our culture was reformed and revised and reviewed and improved.” And “We have to be gentle with each other because we are going through a period of mutations.” … At the end of the program I add some personal comments about how I see the OccupyTogether movement as a sign that hope for a better future yet remains.&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/matrixmasters/iGAG/~4/ZUWi6C7qu30" height="1" width="1"/&gt;</description>

      <description>This is the first part of an interview that Dr. Timothy Leary gave a few months after his release from prison in 1976. The interview took place in Houston, Texas for the local Pacifica Station, KPFT. Unlike most radio interviews, instead of just one person asking the questions this one consisted of a panel of men who at times seemed more like a board of inquiry of some kind. However, it doesn't take long for Dr. Leary to be in full command of the situation. And for historians who are interested in whether or not Leary gave evidence against one of his attorneys, you'll be quite pleased when the questions trend in this direction. … Following the first part of the Timothy Leary interview I play a few sound bites from the LiveStream.com/globalrevolution Web feed of events from the #occupywallstreet demonstrations.&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/matrixmasters/iGAG/~4/MK2N8T3J_JY" height="1" width="1"/&gt;</description>

While this field may be controversial to old-line scientists, of late it has gained more traction and is proving to be the source of much new understanding about the way life has come to be. Our hosts for this conversation are Tom Barbalet and Bruce Damer, two leaders in the field of AL and who are the cornerstones of Biota.org, the Web's leading site for AL information. Surprisingly, their discussion quickly turns from things only true geeks can love to speculations about the work of Terence McKenna, psychedelics, and the possibility that all of us may be in the process of becoming machine elves.&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/matrixmasters/iGAG/~4/N-5abSANWAI" height="1" width="1"/&gt;</description>

      <description>This is another early Terence McKenna lecture that was given sometime in 1984. Particularly considering the year it was delivered, there is more talk about psychedelics and the psychedelic experience than could be found elsewhere. But McKenna doesn't confine himself to only talking about psychedelics. Other topics include some of his early thoughts about language, culture, and the fact that the psychedelic community may be some sort of mutant population that is just waiting for certain selective parameters to change and enable the mutants to steer our species in a new direction (or something like that). And while some of us may be tired of hearing his theories about glossolalia, this early talk of his gives not only a deeper insight to what intrigues him about this phenomenon, but also he carefully explains how he went about invoking it in a mushroom session. … Also, we hear a very clear explanation of how he views the possibility of immortality, and what he has to say may surprise you.&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/matrixmasters/iGAG/~4/NdAHsNclYUo" height="1" width="1"/&gt;</description>

      <description>In today's podcast Matt Pallamary interviews Eileen Workman, co-founder of the Universe Project and who spent sixteen years working in the financial services industry, most recently as a First Vice President of Investments with a major Wall Street investment firm.

Her new book, Sacred Economics: The Currency of Life has been praised by many, including Barbara Marx Hubbard, co-founder and chairperson of the board of The Foundation for Conscious Evolution who says of it:

"Occasionally in human history a clear voice of good sense and compassion rises from the multitudes caught in the memetic mud of obsolete ideas about current reality. Thomas Jefferson was such a voice when he stated: "All men are created equal" at a time when there was no equality, at all.  So now Eileen Workman sends a clear and intelligent message: We can live beyond the current monetary economy better, longer, kinder and more joyfully, and here is how to begin. Even though it might seem impossible, as the system continues to breakdown and the inequalities grow, her voice increasingly serves us as a guide to the next stage of evolutionary economics. We should all read it and place our faith and actions in the good sense it offers us, guiding us toward the next era of economics in the coming age."&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/matrixmasters/iGAG/~4/gapqf4MTm4E" height="1" width="1"/&gt;</description>

      <description>Today's program features what I consider to be the finest interview of Dr. Albert Hofmann that there is. It was conducted in 1993 via telephone by Peter Gorman, then the editor of  “High Times” magazine. Thanks to Peter's excellent handling of this interview, we get to hear a relaxed Albert Hofmann, unscripted, and at the top of his form when it came to retelling the events of his first LSD trips. From his amusement at how the bicycle ride became so famous to a description of his work with R. Gordon Wasson in discovering psilocybin as the active ingredient in magic mushrooms, this interview is packed with stories that Dr. Hofmann seems to relish telling yet one more time again. And what was a new story for me was to hear Uncle Albert tell about smoking Salvia divinorum in Mexico with Wasson. … Furthermore, he explains why he was able to identify the active principle of magic mushrooms, psilocybin, when all the other labs failed … instead of using animals to test his extracts, he and his colleagues tested it on themselves. … And thanks to Peter's expert questioning, we get to hear what Dr. Hofmann thought about Ken Kesey and Timothy Leary. And it may surprise you to learn what he thought about the Hippies and their use of LSD … AND that he had tried MDMA!&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/matrixmasters/iGAG/~4/LwwbGwAtmak" height="1" width="1"/&gt;</description>

Gordon Wasson in discovering psilocybin as the active ingredient in magic mushrooms, this interview is packed with stories that Dr. Hofmann seems to relish telling yet one more time again. And what was a new story for me was to hear Uncle Albert tell about smoking Salvia divinorum in Mexico with Wasson. … Furthermore, he explains why he was able to identify the active principle of magic mushrooms, psilocybin, when all the other labs failed … instead of using animals to test his extracts, he and his colleagues tested it on themselves. … And thanks to Peter's expert questioning, we get to hear what Dr. Hofmann thought about Ken Kesey and Timothy Leary. And it may surprise you to learn what he thought about the Hippies and their use of LSD … AND that he had tried MDMA! </itunes:summary><itunes:keywords>consciousness,psychedelic,entheogen,culture,McKenna,LSD,psilocybin,cannabis,marijuana</itunes:keywords><link>http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/matrixmasters/iGAG/~3/LwwbGwAtmak/280-GormanHofmann.mp3</link><feedburner:origLink>http://matrixmasters.net/archive/Various/280-GormanHofmann.mp3</feedburner:origLink><enclosure url="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/matrixmasters/iGAG/~5/LwwbGwAtmak/280-GormanHofmann.mp3" length="38400000" type="text/audio" /><feedburner:origEnclosureLink>http://matrixmasters.net/archive/Various/280-GormanHofmann.mp3</feedburner:origEnclosureLink></item>

      <description>As us Monty Python fans love to hear, “Now for something completely different.” Well, not really. But today's program is a little different in that instead of featuring just one speaker we have an audio collage that includes Allen Ginsberg, Ram Das, and Laura Huxley. A finer collection of psychedelic elders you would be hard-pressed to find.

First of all is a rare recording of a telephone interview of Allen Ginsberg by then “High Times” editor, Peter Gorman. When Gorman asked for a story about Timothy Leary, Ginsberg tells of the time that Leary came to his New York apartment to meet Jack Kerouac and they took psilocybin together Next is a brief conversation that Peter has with Ram Das during which we learn some more of the background of the early days at Millbrook and the interesting series of events that led up to going there. The last segment is another Peter Gorman interview, this time with Laura Huxley in which she tells of some of her own experiences with LSD. It's a short program but packed with interesting historical ancetdotes.&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/matrixmasters/iGAG/~4/bJ5Xp6ukKk8" height="1" width="1"/&gt;</description>

And is well known, some of the participants in this early psychedelic research included notable celebrities such as Cary Grant and Jack Nicholson. One of my favorite quotes from this podcast is when Dr. Janiger says, “[The Sixties was] a time when people began to see that what was laid down for them as obligatory reality was not obligatory.”&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/matrixmasters/iGAG/~4/ptlmBB95dJQ" height="1" width="1"/&gt;</description>

      <description>This is the second part of a 1994 telephone interview that Peter Gorman (author and former editor of High Times Magazine) conducted with Dennis McKenna. In this part we learn of the curious coincidences that led Dennis to the successful conclusion of his own Ph.D. work and ends with an honest evaluation of his brother Terence's work. For example, at one point Dennis says, “He [Terence McKenna] will never let a fact get in the way of making a provocative statement. He's a good story teller, but I think it's important to remember that they are stories, and that he often makes mistakes in his lectures.” Later on in the podcast, Dennis follows up by saying, “I'm sure that Terence views it as theater. I can't believe that he takes what he says seriously. I mean, I can tell you that he doesn't. Much of what he says he says it because it's going to get a rise out of somebody. He's always been that way.”&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/matrixmasters/iGAG/~4/SVUE7bIS1RU" height="1" width="1"/&gt;</description>

      <description>This is the first part of an interview that Peter Gorman did with Dennis McKenna in 1994. In addition to hearing some interesting boyhood stories about the brothers McKenna, we learn of some of the things that were major influences on their lives. Peter's interviewing expertise shines through in many of the stories he elicits from Dennis, along with comments such as, “I think that ayahuasca is actually much more controllable than mushrooms. . . . I think that it is quite an amazing tool for self-understanding and for exploration. I think that it's good for you, actually physically and psychologically good for you.” Later, Dennis goes on to say, “I think that Christianity linked with Calvinism has a hard time dealing with what you might call facts of biology, which in another phrase is sex, drugs, and rock 'n roll. In some ways, life is about sex, drugs, and rock 'n roll. Biology is about those things.”&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/matrixmasters/iGAG/~4/7Nxd43sSP_0" height="1" width="1"/&gt;</description>

      <description>In this October 1983 talk given in Berkeley, California, Terence McKenna speaks about the unspeakable, the essence of various kinds of psychedelic experiences. In addition to hearing some of his early adaptations of his ideas about the importance of the evolution of language, we are treated to thoughts such as, "It seemed probable to me that this phenomenon encountered in deep psychedelic experiences with psilocybin actually has a potential historical impact. It is a kind of human ability, which is at present submerged in the psyche, contactable only by the shamanic means of journeying into historical hyperspace. In other words, of going into that place where the adumbrations of the future are intense enough that you can have an intimation, at least, of what is to come.”&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/matrixmasters/iGAG/~4/Q9VetoksvKk" height="1" width="1"/&gt;</description>

      <description>Today I'm going to play two talks that I've wanted to get out to you for a while but just never seemed to get around to them. The first talk is a somewhat informal question and answer session that Ann Shulgin led just after one of Sasha's talks at the 2001 Entheobotany Conference in Palenque, Mexico. As you'll hear, the Palenque sessions were generally small, informal, and full of interesting information, much of which came from the audience.

The second talk was given by Dr. William Rowlandson, who is co-Director of the Centre for the Study of Myth at the University of Kent. And the talk he gave is titled: “Borges and McKenna – Iconoclasm, Boundary Dissolution, and Living Symbolically”.&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/matrixmasters/iGAG/~4/bBPIQFz0wc0" height="1" width="1"/&gt;</description>

If you have ever wondered what people are talking about when they tell of the wisdom of indigenous people in regards to ways in which this Earth is covered with interconnected life, this is a talk that will give you a deep understanding of how wise these people are.

      <description>In this podcast we get to hear another recording from the Timothy Leary Archive. This talk was given sometime in the early 1980s in Minneapolis/St. Paul, Minnesota to an audience of about 200 people. Leary's main topic for the evening was evolution and ways in which he disagreed with the standard Darwinian approach to evolution. In his view, evolution is a hands-on project that we all are involved with. Along the way, Timothy delivers a few of the memorable gems that we've come to expect from him, such as, "I like the Pope. I think he's the finest mind of the 12th century,” and “I've always hated the Second Law of Thermodynamics.” But he also has his moments of seriousness like when he says, “One thing that drugs give you: Personal options to change your own mind, a way of rewarding yourself, of teaching yourself, of activating yourself, of changing yourself. And one thing that the power-holders do not want you to do as an individual is to change your own mind and learn how to reward yourself.”&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/matrixmasters/iGAG/~4/ae5ZjgN_gPA" height="1" width="1"/&gt;</description>

And one thing that the power-holders do not want you to do as an individual is to change your own mind and learn how to reward yourself.”</itunes:summary><itunes:keywords>consciousness,psychedelic,entheogen,culture,McKenna,LSD,psilocybin,cannabis,marijuana</itunes:keywords><link>http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/matrixmasters/iGAG/~3/ae5ZjgN_gPA/272-LearyEvolution.mp3</link><feedburner:origLink>http://matrixmasters.net/archive/TimothyLeary/272-LearyEvolution.mp3</feedburner:origLink><enclosure url="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/matrixmasters/iGAG/~5/ae5ZjgN_gPA/272-LearyEvolution.mp3" length="36500000" type="text/audio" /><feedburner:origEnclosureLink>http://matrixmasters.net/archive/TimothyLeary/272-LearyEvolution.mp3</feedburner:origEnclosureLink></item>

      <title>271-Harrison: "Weaving Modern Ritual from Traditional Roots"</title>

      <description>Today's program features a talk that Kat Harrison gave during the January 2001 Entheobotany Conference at Palenque, Mexico. In it she teaches some of the many ways to create modern rituals, along with the reasons why this is so important. Along the way, Kat tells what it was like to come of age during the period we now call The Sixties. She has practical advice as well, such as: “Why one [psychedelic medicine] may be your best friend's ally and not your ally is a mystery. And maybe you can solve that mystery and maybe not. But you should honor the fact that some things work for you and some things are not your medicine, even though everyone around you appears to be having a good time.” Another wise thought of hers is, “You don't lead with your head. You let your heart and your body tell you what to do in these [introspective psychedelic] moments. Then if you think it's time to get up and bolt out into the street, you let your head come in and tell you,  'Don't! Sit down. You're not going anywhere.' ”&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/matrixmasters/iGAG/~4/fSrq_A9KXZ0" height="1" width="1"/&gt;</description>

      <description>This marks the sixth anniversary of podcasts from the Psychedelic Salon, and it features yet another old Terence McKenna lecture. This one was given in December of 1982, which was in the early days of his public speaking career. McKenna's focus for the talk is an exploration of what happens once a person ingests a psychedelic substance in the tryptamine family. And while he tells some stories about using these substances that sound quite inviting, he also adds the caution that: “I think one of the interesting things about judging a drug is to see how eager people are to do it the second time. If they're eager to do it the second time it's probably not worth bothering about, because what is necessary to have validity in these experiences is the terror. The terror is a stamp of validity on the experience, because it means this is real.” And on a more positive note he adds: “The future is bound to be psychedelic because the future belongs to the mind.”

Also, in this podcast I announce the availability of my novel, “The Genesis Generation,” as an eBook that is available on Amazon and other online retailing Web sties.&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/matrixmasters/iGAG/~4/tI4s2j0Nx5Q" height="1" width="1"/&gt;</description>

      <description>Today we re-join Jonathan Ott at the 2004 Mind States conference in Oaxaca, Mexico. Here is what the conference program had to say about this talk:

Jonathan Ott will give a talk titled “From Octli/Pulque and Xochioctli to Mezcal and Vino de Mezcal Tequila”.

The ethnopharmacognosy of inebriating pre-Columbian potions based on octli or pulque, wine of various species of Agave, with special reference to numerous inebriating additives; traditional foods and beverages made from mezcal Agaves; and colonial development of distilled mezcal from fermented, cooked mezcal Agaves. Finally, more recent development of Vino de Mezcal Tequila or Tequila, a regional type of mezcal brandy, from cooked hearts of Agave tequillense or blue agave.&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/matrixmasters/iGAG/~4/r4AjFYdbsGU" height="1" width="1"/&gt;</description>

      <description>This program is another selection from the Timothy Leary archive. It features an October 1990 debate at Penn State University between Dr. Leary and his arch-enemy, the scandalous G. Gordon Liddy. One of my favorite segments in this debate, which wasn't all that polite at times, is when Leary pointed out the fact that he had spent more time in the U.S. Military service than Liddy had, but that Liddy had spent more time in prison than Leary had. Another Leary gem is when he said, “As far as this election is concerned, I urge you, don't vote for either a Democrat or a Republican. It just encourages the bastards.”&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/matrixmasters/iGAG/~4/qaAF3rxQXg8" height="1" width="1"/&gt;</description>

      <description>In this early (November 1982) Terence McKenna lecture we hear him describe what took place during what he calls “The Experiment at La Chorrera” as “very loose science or very tight magic”. We also hear some of his earliest formulations of what ultimately became his most-remembered lines of thought. One of my favorite quotes from this talk is: “This situation called 'history' is totally unique. It will only last for a moment. It began a moment ago. It will only last for a moment. But in that moment there is like this tremendous burst of static as the monkey goes to godhood.” And along the way he again presents solid arguments as to why the psychedelic experience is of such great importance to the future of our species. In particular, he singles out the process of dying as one that can benefit from what is learned through the intelligent use of psychedelics.&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/matrixmasters/iGAG/~4/CIXaKf58H5I" height="1" width="1"/&gt;</description>

      <description>Dennis McKenna (in a wide-ranging interview with David Ellenbogen for WKCR 89.9 FM in New York City) gives us some of his views on the neurochemistry of the brain and where and how he sees consciousness fitting into the big picture of the cosmos. And his views on ayahuasca are worth hearing. For example, Dennis says, “Ayahuasca is now a global phenomenon, and this is part of the plants' reaching out, trying to reach out to larger groups of people and basically hit us upside the head with a two by four and say, 'Hey you monkeys wake up! You're fucking it up! You have to wake up.' ” As to how one goes about finding the vine experience, he wisely concludes, “I think ayahuasca is perfectly capable of finding the people it needs, and the people who need to find ayahuasca will find it. And there's no need for cults or movements or very much human intervention, although a lot of people will be convinced that we must do this.”&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/matrixmasters/iGAG/~4/WN2k2Ecg1AM" height="1" width="1"/&gt;</description>

      <description>“Lawyers Lie” is the title of a book by attorney Eric Hart who is interviewed in this podcast by frequent contributor to the salon, Matt Pallamary. And Eric doesn't mince words when asked very direct questions, such as what do you do if stopped by the police when you have been smoking cannabis in your car. Eric's replay is: “[If you are in police custody] Never say a word. Don't ever talk to the cops under any circumstance. If you're a suspect, or you're being arrested, nothing can be gained from it. They will twist whatever you say. It can only be used against you, just like the famous Miranda advisement. You have a right to remain silent. So remain silent. Even if they're yelling and screaming at you to talk, refuse to talk. That's a basic right that you have. It's one of the only effective rights we have left from the Bill of Rights. So exercise that right, or else whatever you say will be twisted around, and it will end up leading to your conviction.”&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/matrixmasters/iGAG/~4/n27BXVwvUjc" height="1" width="1"/&gt;</description>

The guest host that night was none other than Dr. Timothy Leary, and his topic for discussion that evening was Artificial Intelligence. … For me, one of the highlights was to hear a famous MIT professor predict that home computers would never catch on!</itunes:summary><itunes:keywords>consciousness,psychedelic,entheogen,culture,McKenna,LSD,psilocybin,cannabis,marijuana</itunes:keywords><link>http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/matrixmasters/iGAG/~3/yS3HeQbezDE/264-Leary1983TorontoAI.mp3</link><feedburner:origLink>http://matrixmasters.net/archive/TimothyLeary/264-Leary1983TorontoAI.mp3</feedburner:origLink><enclosure url="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/matrixmasters/iGAG/~5/yS3HeQbezDE/264-Leary1983TorontoAI.mp3" length="65800000" type="text/audil" /><feedburner:origEnclosureLink>http://matrixmasters.net/archive/TimothyLeary/264-Leary1983TorontoAI.mp3</feedburner:origEnclosureLink></item>

      <description>In this final part of Erik Davis' interview with Terence McKenna, not long before his death, Terence talks about life and death and ways in which psychedelics have somewhat prepared him to face his own imminent death. Near the end of this interview he says, “Given how weird life has been, why rush to prejudge death. It's bound to be mighty strange, life was mighty strange, and I'm curious. … It's an interesting situation to be told that you have a very limited amount of life left, because it composes your mind for you, wonderfully.”&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/matrixmasters/iGAG/~4/aTB7HBKGFp8" height="1" width="1"/&gt;</description>

      <description>This is Part 1 of the last interview given by Terence McKenna before his untimely death in April 2000. The interview was conducted by Erik Davis for later publication in Wired Magazine. This recording was made by Erik while at Terence's home in Hawaii at the end of October 1999. And as long ago as that, Terence was already making a plea to support Internet Neutrality, as can be heard in statements like this, “Now let's see if information can liberate. That's why I don't want to do something stupid like die and miss the whole unfoldment of this proposition that knowledge is power, information will liberate. And it will be settled in the next ten or fifteen years. Either they'll get a handle on it, whoever 'they' are, whatever a 'handle means. Or it will slip from their control, and it will be clear that some kind of dialogue is now going on between individual human beings and the sum total of human knowledge, and that nothing can stop it, that some kind of Renaissance, some kind of total new relationship to knowledge and possibility is put in place.”&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/matrixmasters/iGAG/~4/jxo1GpL0Szw" height="1" width="1"/&gt;</description>

      <description>This recording is from the box of cassette tapes that Dianna Slattery sent me a few months back. And I picked it for several reasons. The first one being that it is the oldest recording of Terence McKenna that I've come across so far. It's from December of 1982, and apparently was recorded in someone's living room. 

Interestingly, it was in a case labeled “Psilocybin &amp; The Sands of Time”. But then the tape inside the box was itself labeled “The Definitive UFO Tape  Terence McKenna Dec. 1982” As you will hear, right off the bat, the first question to Terence refers to the “two” books he had written at that point. And he answers by saying that he kept most of his UFO ideas out of The Invisible Landscape. Then he refers to what he calls “the second work, titled, Psilocybin and the UFOs”. No matter what your opinion is about this topic, I think you will find something in this talk to support your hypothesis. It may well be the “definitive” discourse about this subject.&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/matrixmasters/iGAG/~4/LJKr5f-LihU" height="1" width="1"/&gt;</description>

      <description>In the second part of Bruce Damer's interview with film maker Matt Anderson he expands on his concept of a Great Crescendo and among other thought-provoking ideas he says, “You're here not because something put you here and fabricated you and guided the evolution and created the whole planet. It's an emergent phenomenon and so are you. And you are an ongoing story, and the story is written in your genes, but it is also written in your mind. And you have responsibility for this amazing emergent phenomenon.” And even more provocatively he goes on to say, “You don't need religion for miracles. The fact that you exist in all this existence is stacked upon miracles, turtles all the way down. So if we grok that, we don't need religious stories any more.”&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/matrixmasters/iGAG/~4/w8qab30BZdk" height="1" width="1"/&gt;</description>

This talk is actually part of an interview he did with Matt Anderson for his upcoming documentary film FallWinterMovie.com. As always, Bruce gets right to the heart of the matter when he says, “I think in a sense it's the dialogue, it is the control of the dialogue that is the problem here. It's the battle of the airwaves. It's the people we didn't nominate to talk back to us and tell us what our culture is and what our future is and what our politics are. That is the problem.

      <description>A person claiming to be Alan Watts' son says he owns the copyright to this talk. Although he offered no proof of who he is or of ownership, his threat of a lawsuit has caused me to remove this program, as I can't afford a lawyer to fight what I believe is a bogus claim. .... PROGRAM NOTES . . . 

Today I'm featuring an old Alan Watts lecture that is floating around the Net under various names and in several recordings, possibly from different venues. After listening to it, I decided to add to the confusion by calling it "Why Is Christianity Afraid of Sex?" While other religions are also covered, Watts focuses primarily on Christianity and it's obsessively negative preoccupation with almost all sexual activities.

PROGRAM NOTES . . . Today I'm featuring an old Alan Watts lecture that is floating around the Net under various names and in several recordings, possibly from different venues. After listening to it, I decided to add to the confusion by calling it "Why Is Christianity Afraid of Sex?" While other religions are also covered, Watts focuses primarily on Christianity and it's obsessively negative preoccupation with almost all sexual activities.

      <description>Today's talk is part of a Terence McKenna workshop held at Esalen Institute in California sometime in December of 1982. And while his talk is primarily a call to those interested in exploring psychedelic realms, he also has this to say: "I think [taking psychedelic drugs] is very dangerous. I do not tell people that it's safe because I don't have the faith that it's safe. I know what the pharmacological literature says, and it says that it's safe. That at the doses where these effects occur there can't possibly be a problem, but this seems to me to be the naivete of materialists, and we shouldn't be in a hurry to believe them even though it might make us more comfortable to do so. In other words, it's saying the drug may not be toxic, but you may be self-toxic, and you may discover this in the drug experience."&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/matrixmasters/iGAG/~4/PMrXaR55iVg" height="1" width="1"/&gt;</description>

      <description>Today's podcast is a collage of talks by Timothy Leary and Ram Das. We begin with a 1966 interview of Dr. Leary on KPFK radio in Berkeley. That is followed by a 1973 interview with Ram Das on the same station and in which Ram Das discusses the end of his involvement with Leary as well as his thoughts about why everything came apart at the seams. The last segment is part of a 1986 interview of Timothy Leary on the Larry King on his radio program. As expected, Leary ends with a call to think for yourself: "I love institutions. They're intelligence tests. Institutions are prisons that you have to escape from. . . . The only thing is don't get trapped in them. The most addictive, dangerous, mind-screwing thing in the world is conformity to an organization."&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/matrixmasters/iGAG/~4/E3KRSyGuqn4" height="1" width="1"/&gt;</description>

The main program is a talk given by Dr. Cameron Adams to the Student Psychedelic Society at the University of Kent. In his talk Dr. Adams explains some of the biochemistry involved in mystical and psychedelic experiences in a way that is very easy to follow. At the end of today’s program I also play a short segment from a recent podcast from Dopefiend.co.uk in which the Dopefiend perfectly echos my sentiments about the recent defeat of California's Proposition 19.&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/matrixmasters/iGAG/~4/apmkClT6TQ8" height="1" width="1"/&gt;</description>

      <description>This podcast brings us to the last part of the April 1986 workshop conducted by Kat Harrison and Terence McKenna under the Teaching Tree at the Ojai Foundation in California. I almost didn't play this part because I was afraid that it would just be a rehash of his "monkeys eating mushrooms" story. But then as I got further into it, I realized that this was one of his earliest public accounts of this hypothesis, which was first suggested to him by his brother Dennis. And since this was one of his earlier accounts he added a lot more detail than I've heard before, poetic details I guess you would say, but in any event, just like in the last podcast where he gave a more clear explanation of his Timewave idea, in this talk you will hear what I think is perhaps his best explanation of how he thought us humans first began to expand our consciousness beyond mere animal consciousness.&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/matrixmasters/iGAG/~4/yVEcvJtgLvE" height="1" width="1"/&gt;</description>

      <description>Today we pick up with Terence McKenna in the middle of his "good shit" story, but we are then rewarded with his telling of the origin of the fable of the good shit, that it first originated in Java. From there the topics were determined by questions from the participants. One such question resulted in this answer, "The interesting thing about outer space, we are not going to go 'through' space to other worlds, that will be very incidental to going into space. Going into space means going into space, that space itself is a medium with unique properties for a species such as ourselves." ... About midway through this talk Terence gives one of the most beautiful descriptions of the psychedelic experience that I can ever remember hearing. And he ends with this rousing thought, "The culmination of man's god-making effort in time will be the perfection and the release of the human soul. And it's not that we are 'doing' it, you see. It's that a natural law that we were previously unaware of is inexorably unfolding."&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/matrixmasters/iGAG/~4/cfUNc39cZQ8" height="1" width="1"/&gt;</description>

      <description>In this second installment of a 1986 workshop at the Ojai Foundation in California, Terence McKenna and Kat Harrison continue expanding on their views of the world from a psychedelic perspective. As usual, Terence waxes eloquent on thoughts such as, "This is the anguish of the ancestors. This is the sacred trust that must not be betrayed. The pogroms, and the invasions, and the atrocities conducted across history can only be, somehow, redeemed if we, who are the living wavefront of this genetic experience do not fumble the ball. All our ancestors are watching to see how we will do." And then he ends with his famous "good shit" story that took place during the La Chorrera experiments.&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/matrixmasters/iGAG/~4/muNhGG6H6AU" height="1" width="1"/&gt;</description>

      <description>A person claiming to be Alan Watts' son says he owns the copyright to this talk. Although he offered no proof of who he is or of ownership, his threat of a lawsuit has caused me to remove this program, as I can't afford a lawyer to fight what I believe is a bogus claim. . . . PROGRAM NOTES . . . 

In this two part program we hear Alan Watts talking first about the divine spark that is within us all and how modern psychiatry, with its endless drug prescriptions, leads away from that ideal. For example, Watts says at one point: "Indeed one might say that psychoanalysis is based on Newtonian mechanics and in fact could be called psycho-hydrolics." ... The second short talk, also by Watts, concerns the usually avoided topic of death, and by the time he reaches the end of this little piece he has definitely convinced me to not worry about the inevitable.&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/matrixmasters/iGAG/~4/wLFlpV2_n-k" height="1" width="1"/&gt;</description>

The second short talk, also by Watts, concerns the usually avoided topic of death, and by the time he reaches the end of this little piece he has definitely convinced me to not worry about the inevitable.</itunes:summary><itunes:keywords>consciousness,psychedelic,entheogen,culture,McKenna,LSD,psilocybin,cannabis,marijuana</itunes:keywords><link>http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/matrixmasters/iGAG/~3/wLFlpV2_n-k/247-WattsDivineDeath.mp3</link><feedburner:origLink>http://matrixmasters.net/archive/Various/247-WattsDivineDeath.mp3</feedburner:origLink><enclosure url="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/matrixmasters/iGAG/~5/wLFlpV2_n-k/247-WattsDivineDeath.mp3" length="29900000" type="text/audio" /><feedburner:origEnclosureLink>http://matrixmasters.net/archive/Various/247-WattsDivineDeath.mp3</feedburner:origEnclosureLink></item>

      <description>In today's podcast we join Bruce Damer for his 2010 talk at the Buddhafield Festival. He titled this talk "Elves, Egos, and Avatars" and integrated a couple of Terence McKenna sound bites into the mix, along with an exploration of some of Eckhart Tolle's ideas about ego. He ends with a question we all should be asking ourselves, "It's the strength of the survivors that's always going to get you through. So how do we create a critical mass of people ready for the next phase, ready to build that new Earth?" ... I end the podcast with a brief remembrance of my brother, Dr. Miguel Jose Hagerty-Fox.&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/matrixmasters/iGAG/~4/L80vpnKVvDQ" height="1" width="1"/&gt;</description>

      <description>Having witnessed a UFO “at close range” himself, it is no wonder that Terence McKenna takes the phenomenon of unidentified astral objects quite seriously. However, that doesn't mean that he has any better idea what they are than you and I do. One of my favorite ideas of his from this podcast is when he says: “Are we being visited? Or is there another tenant in the building that we are unaware of?" ... Another interesting concept he plays with is: "I believe that that is the purpose of the UFO, to inject uncertainty into the male-dominated, paternalistic, rational, solar myth under which we are suffering." After his 40 minute UFO talk I also included a nine minute sound bite from a 1991 impromptu appearance in Mannheim where he says: "This is why psychedelics are illegal. They don't care whether people jump out of windows or any of that. They're not interested in public health. They do not want people to take back their minds."&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/matrixmasters/iGAG/~4/hamFI2KRDWA" height="1" width="1"/&gt;</description>

      <description>Once again we hear how wonderfully optimistic Dr. Timothy Leary was when we were just 15 years short of the millennium. Although we now can see how hopelessly naive he was at the time, I still find his still youth-filled, optimistic enthusiasm quite refreshing, especially for the times we are now it. And while there are a few messages and stories we have heard from the good doctor before, his re-telling of them is always fresh. By the end of his talk, which was given in Santa Barbara, California on the 28th of January in 1985, he gives us an insight as to how he was seeing the personal computer revolution right as it was just then beginning to take form.&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/matrixmasters/iGAG/~4/5g85iFxDxto" height="1" width="1"/&gt;</description>

      <description>This recording is from the second half of an event that was held on July 24, 1988 to raise money for the Albert Hofmann Foundation. The first half (which I haven't found a recording of yet) included talks by Paul Krassner, Laura Huxley, and Timothy Leary. However a few minutes of the Leary talk are included here. The main part of this recording is a scintillating talk by Ram Das in which he says things such as: "And it feels to me that as long as I live I will still be growing into what happened to me on the first psychedelic experience," and "What has happened is that the Sixties unleashed something extraordinarily powerful that is still reverberating and echoing in this culture, and actually in the world. And what that released was a recognition in people that they were free to change, institutions and themselves."&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/matrixmasters/iGAG/~4/lSQGRIVQJKM" height="1" width="1"/&gt;</description>

      <description>In this continuation of a 1984 workshop in which he gave himself the title of Philosophical Gadfly, Terence McKenna takes us on a journey through the place he calls the invisible landscape. One of his raps is that "history is the departure of a species for the stars", which may give us a clue as to why he departed for the stars so early, paving our way, no doubt. His consideration of how we now control the biological evolution of our own species leads him to say, "We are creatures of information and the imagination. The monkey we are already beginning to transform and shed. We don't look like the other monkeys, and we look less like them all the time." ... And an interesting little factoid comes out that already in 1984, before the Web, Terence was already using the Internet with his Apple II and a $350 modem.&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/matrixmasters/iGAG/~4/6YAv8bYMGIA" height="1" width="1"/&gt;</description>

      <description>In this recording of a small 1984 gathering in Northern California, Terence McKenna holds forth on ayahuasca, his research in the Amazon, and the amanita muscaria mushroom. As is often the case, this workshop was shaped mainly by questions from the participants, which brought about this interesting quotation: "You must be aware that I have other wrinkles, the extraterrestrial angle, the end of history angle, several different things, but all of these things were inspired by our belief that these Amazon peoples have a technology for exploring the modalities of the unconscious that is centuries ahead of us." And his 1984 take on death is also notable: "I imagine death to be a kind of release into the imagination."&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/matrixmasters/iGAG/~4/xEIlAudL_n0" height="1" width="1"/&gt;</description>

      <description>This may be one of Terence McKenna's finest and most important talks. It was recorded in 1996 in Mannheim, Germany and was recorded during the time he and Sheldon Rocklin were filming the documentary for Mystic Fire, which was originally titled 'Coincidencia Oppositorum: A Union of Opposites'. And while it has now been more than a decade since it was given, you will find that it remains as fresh as if it was delivered last night. The program notes for this podcast contain the most McKenna quotes of any talk we have yet heard here in the salon. Just one quote may give you the flavor of what you will hear: "In the 60's then, LSD was not sufficient, even coupled with rock and roll it only brought repression. It was like a failed alchemy. Instead of the dissolving and recrystallizing at a higher and more angelic level thousands of prisons were built, and the entire thing failed. But this spirit is THE spirit, the spirit of life itself, the spirit of novelty itself, and it will not be suppressed for long in any time or place. So now again it comes. ... It's a spirit of dissent that says we will not serve the values of materialism, the values of the ego, and the values that separate and break down the community. So here it is again."&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/matrixmasters/iGAG/~4/FHSAE6Ofepk" height="1" width="1"/&gt;</description>

      <description>Dr. Lilly begins with a description of his first LSD experience in an isolation chamber (300mg IM) in the Virgin Islands in 1964, saying about it, "I was scared stiff, absolutely terrified." He is followed by Dr. Oscar Janiger who gives a few brief remarks before Terence McKenna introduces Dr. Albert Hofmann by famously saying, "Psychology without psychedelics is pissing into the wind." The Dr. Hofmann takes the stage for a talk that you will most likely listen to more than once. One of my favorite quotes of his is, "Of greatest significance to me has been the insight that I obtained as a fundamental understanding from all my LSD experiences that what one commonly takes as the reality by no means it defines anything fixed but represents a thing that's ambiguous, that there is not only one but there are many realities, each compromising a different consciousness also of the ego."&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/matrixmasters/iGAG/~4/ipsK0SRqZfc" height="1" width="1"/&gt;</description>

      <description>This is the first part of an event that was held at The Scottish

Rite Temple in Los Angeles on October 2, 1988 to honor Dr. Albert Hofmann on the 50th anniversary of his discovery of LSD. The MC that night was none other than Terence McKenna, and besides a few words from Terence, we also hear from Stanley Krippner and Andrew Weil, who not only have many kind words for Dr. Hofmann but also add some interesting insights about their own work with LSD, such as when Terence said: "We have the tools, the intellect, the will to create a caring global culture. It isn't going to come without a recognition of the power of the psychedelic experience. The psychedelic experience is the birth right of every human being on the planet. It is as much a basic part of each and every one of us as our sexuality, our national identity, our consciousness of self. And any society which attempts to hold back or impede this dimension of self-expression, when the history of that society is written, it will be called barbarous." ... And from Dr. Weil: "And here it seems to me is the fundamental absurdity of the way our science has developed: The most obvious fact of our existence is that we are conscious. That is the most obvious, most important aspect of our existence. How can you construct a world view, how can you construct a system that tries to explain the universe and leave that out? And yet that is what our science tries to do."&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/matrixmasters/iGAG/~4/i8IN-G4_FZE" height="1" width="1"/&gt;</description>

      <title>236-Aldous Huxley: "The Politics of Ecology"</title>

      <description>In this lecture (delivered just one year before he died in 1963) Aldous Huxley explains that the most pressing problems that lie before us will be brought about by the ecological devastation that comes with a population explosion. With a world population of about three million at the time, Huxley accurately predicted that it would double by today, which it has. He begins this lecture saying, "When advancing science and acceleratingly progressive technology alter man's long-standing relationships with the planet on which he lives, revolutionize his societies, and at the same time equip his rulers with new and immensely more powerful instruments of domination what ought we to do? What can we do?" And among his other observations are: "My own view is that it is only by shifting our collective intention from the merely political to the basic biological aspects to the human situation that we can hope to mitigate and shorten the time of troubles into which it would seem we are now moving. We have to get it into our collective heads that the basic problem now confronting us is ecological."&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/matrixmasters/iGAG/~4/qFm9ubb84bY" height="1" width="1"/&gt;</description>

      <title>235-Various: "Osmond, Stolaroff, &amp; Hubbard - 1964"</title>

      <description>On October 30, 1964, Dr. Humphry Osmond, Myron Stolaroff, Willis Harman, and Al Hubbard took LSD together. The next day they discussed what was learned. This is a recording of that gathering, and it is the first of the recovered recordings from The Stolaroff Collection. Their conversation took place on November 1, 1964 and most likely hasn't been heard since the day this recording was made on Myron's reel-to-reel Ampex tape recorder. Among other interesting parts of this conversation are their views of the newly raging controversies then being fueled by the work of Timothy Leary and Ram Das. Needless to say, scientific researchers like Osmond and Stolaroff were not exactly enamored with the emerging psychedelic culture that would soon lead us to the Hippies and beyond. They also found a connection between their work and Tielhard de Chardin's writings about the noosphere. My favorite part is an appearance by the legendary, Al Hubbard, the Johnny Appleseed of LSD. While I'm sure there are other recordings of Hubbard, this is the first time I have heard his voice, and it comes in the context of Humphry, Myron, and him discussing their previous day's acid trip together. If you are interested in the early history of the psychedelic movement, this recording is not to be missed!&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/matrixmasters/iGAG/~4/WHvC4E-YGa8" height="1" width="1"/&gt;</description>

      <description>Today's talk is the missing Tape 4 from the first McKenna, Abraham, and Sheldrake  Trialogue sessions recorded in 1989. Terence begins by telling a rather amazing story about a walk he had on a beach that turned into a fractal psychedelic experience, and without the aid of any substances I should add. From there it takes a while to get to the World Soul, and then after talking for a while, they discover that they are actually talking about different concepts! A couple of my favorite McKenna quotes from this talk are: "For my money, monotheism is the single most reactionary force in all of human history. I don't even know what is running second," and "Democracy is a step away from anarchy."&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/matrixmasters/iGAG/~4/SlQXyYzp7ug" height="1" width="1"/&gt;</description>

      <description>The talk I've picked for today is from April 23, 1983, and it was given at Harvard University on the occasion of the 20th anniversary of Timothy Leary and Ram Das, then Richard Alpert, being kicked out of Harvard. There are a lot of little gems here, but one of my favorites from Timothy Leary was, "[So Emerson] came to Harvard Divinity School, gave that famous speech in which he said, 'Don't look for god in the temples, nor in the buildings, nor in the pulpits, look within, find divinity inside yourself, drop out, become self-reliant (translated as do your own thing) and for, I believe thirty-three years, he was not allowed back on this sacred territory.

      <description>Today we have a two-part program that begins with a reminiscence by Bruce Damer about how he came to know Terence McKenna. I then follow that with a recording of one of the last conversations Bruce and Terence had at Terence's house on the Big Island of Hawaii just a few weeks before Terence was laid low by a tumor in his brain.



One of the reasons I think it might be interesting for you to hear this conversation is to get a feel for what it was like to hang around with the bard McKenna. While you might think that he did most of the talking, you will find that the opposite is true, and much like Aldous Huxley, Terence did a lot of questioning and listening. It wasn't only from books that they acquired their particular views of the world.&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/matrixmasters/iGAG/~4/ty5I2BPC-d4" height="1" width="1"/&gt;</description>

It wasn't only from books that they acquired their particular views of the world. </itunes:summary><itunes:keywords>consciousness,psychedelic,entheogen,culture,McKenna,LSD,psilocybin,cannabis,marijuana</itunes:keywords><link>http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/matrixmasters/iGAG/~3/ty5I2BPC-d4/231-BruceTerence1999.mp3</link><feedburner:origLink>http://matrixmasters.net/archive/BruceDamer/231-BruceTerence1999.mp3</feedburner:origLink><enclosure url="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/matrixmasters/iGAG/~5/ty5I2BPC-d4/231-BruceTerence1999.mp3" length="31800000" type="text/audio" /><feedburner:origEnclosureLink>http://matrixmasters.net/archive/BruceDamer/231-BruceTerence1999.mp3</feedburner:origEnclosureLink></item>

      <description>In this final session of the last trialogue between Rupert Sheldrake, Terence McKenna, and Ralph Abraham the discussion is begun by Ralph when he states, "The edge of the millennium, any edge of any of the millennia, is particularly important to those revolutionary souls who want to make a change in things. It is a special time." ... and I need not point out that we are still at the very leading edge of this new millennium. And to the provocative question raised by Ralph, Terence answered, "This is a moment of enormous opportunity, and those who find themselves in this moment with power, defined however you care to define it, have a moral obligation to act. ... What we must become is clear."&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/matrixmasters/iGAG/~4/cf8VZXV0tmI" height="1" width="1"/&gt;</description>

      <description>This is a continuation of the last Trialogue that was held between Rupert Sheldrake, Ralph Abraham, and Terence McKenna. This session is kicked off by Terence McKenna who shifts the focus to The Evolutionary Mind AND the Machines. A couple of his comments include: "What is important about nature is that it is information. And the real tension is not between matter and spirit, or time and space, the real tension is between information and nonsense." And, "Vast amounts of the world that we call human is already under the control of artificial intelligences, including very vital parts of our political and social dynamo." Then Ralph and Rupert try to pin him down on a few inconsistencies. Following the trialogue I have added a short comment by Bruce Damer regarding the technical impossibility of uploading one's consciousness to a computer any time in the foreseeable future.&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/matrixmasters/iGAG/~4/9utn8KoL4-Y" height="1" width="1"/&gt;</description>

The complete video of this Trialogue is also available through Google Video under the title "Trialogue at the End of the Millennium". By the end of their first hour, Ralph didn't think they had made any progress in their discussion, Terence thought great progress had been made, and Rupert was wondering whether our Sun was having relationship issues with its peers.

      <description>In today's podcast we hear from two psychedelic luminaries, Sasha Shulgin and Alan Watts. The Shulgin talk is one that he gave at MIT on December 1, 2005 and can also be found in video format on the MIT Web site. The date and location of the Alan Watts talk is unknown but it contains one of his best illustrations of what may be the true condition of us humans and concludes with the observation that, "You see, it doesn't matter in what form you begin. Whether you begin again as a human being, or as a fruit fly, butterfly, or a beetle, or a bird, it feels the same way that you feel now. So we're really all in the same place."&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/matrixmasters/iGAG/~4/fBtbBZ_XZms" height="1" width="1"/&gt;</description>

      <description>In this final installment of Terence McKenna's 1992 workshop titled "Hermeticism and Alchemy" he points out that "History itself is a kind of alchemical process," and then goes into a political rant unlike any I've heard him give before. Two of my favorite gems are: "What we have to do is knock off this fantasy of being citizens inside a democratic state. I mean, what we are are the propagandized masses inside a Fascist dictatorship." and "I think that the Third Reich was a Sunday school picnic compared to the population policies of the Roman Catholic Church. ... In a civilized political environment those people would be placed under immediate arrest."&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/matrixmasters/iGAG/~4/9zLLbZ6wBhM" height="1" width="1"/&gt;</description>

He also gives his opinion of what the glue is that holdsl the world wide psychedelic community together. A couple of my favorite quotes from this session include: "So in a way, one way of thinking about psychedelics is that they empower language. It's a way to force the evolution of language. The way you stretch the envelope of culture is by creating language." And:  "The mind is not a form of intelligence. The mind is the theater in which intelligence is manifested.

      <description>In this two hour Terence Day (April 3rd) podcast, we hear Terence McKenna waxing his poetic best. For example:



"Sometime in the last 50,000 years, before 12,000 years ago, a kind of paradise came into existence, a situation in which men and women, parents and children, people and animals, human institutions and the land, all were in dynamic balance. And not in any primitive sense at all. Language was fully developed. Poetry may have been at its climax. Dance, magic, poetics, altruism, philosophy, there's no reason to think that these things were not practiced as adroitly as we practice them today. And it was under the boundary-dissolving influence of psilocybin."



"So what needs to be done is to spread the idea that anxiety is inappropriate. It's sort of like we who are psychedelic have to function as sitters for society, because society is going to thrash, and resist, and think it's dying, and be deluded, and regurgitate unconscious material, and so forth and so on. And the role then, I think, for psychedelic people is to try and spread calm."&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/matrixmasters/iGAG/~4/cFlz9AghRbs" height="1" width="1"/&gt;</description>

He begins discussing his main project, the EvoGrid, and says, "Perhaps Gaia, the biosphere, has a devious plan which is to allow one of its species, one of its offspring, to create a mechanism to create new forms of life." Bruce then goes on to discuss several other fascinating topics that I think you will enjoy hearing.&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/matrixmasters/iGAG/~4/Hdg7gJyfBiE" height="1" width="1"/&gt;</description>

However, once you hear his logic for such a proposal you may see the method in his madness so to speak. And then there is his wonderful pronunciation that, "The legend goes like this, that in the high valleys around Basil, Switzerland there are alpine villages where the inhabitants have not drawn an un-hallucinated breath in 500 years." ... it is the good Doctor Leary at the top of his form.&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/matrixmasters/iGAG/~4/ejlJ0yPTf2g" height="1" width="1"/&gt;</description>

      <description>Among other stories, Terence tells of his UFO encounter in the Amazon in great detail ... one of his best tellings of this experience. He then goes on in an almost ambivalent way about his feelings about crop circles. Before long, though, he gets back to answering more questions about the smoked DMT experience, eventually comparing it to the archetype of the circus. He also explains his theory that crop circles may be the work of stem-bending Ninja Japanese tourists and that schizophrenics may actually be driven mad because they smell funny.&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/matrixmasters/iGAG/~4/qbwWNuLQG3A" height="1" width="1"/&gt;</description>

It is THE secret. There is a secret, and this is it. It is the secret that the world is not only not the way you think it is.

Today we hear a long-lost lecture that the Sixties' philosopher, Alan Watts, gave in which he speaks in favor of the use of LSD. Among some of his comments are, "LSD is simply an exploratory instrument, like a microscope or a telescope, except this one's inside you instead of outside you. And according to your capacity and knowledge, you can use a microscope or a telescope to advantage. So in the same way, according to your capacity and your knowledge you can use an interior instrument to your advantage ... or just for kicks!"

      <description>This talk has appeared under several different titles, including "Empowering Hope in Dark Times", "Alchemy", and "Unfolding the Stone" among others. IMO it is the most positive and hopeful talk that we have yet heard from Terence here in the salon. For example, he says, "It's absolutely irrational to not be filled with the fire of consuming hope. You just have to overcome the leveling that we inheirit from these empty, existential, scientific ideas."&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/matrixmasters/iGAG/~4/r5pkTgZonBo" height="1" width="1"/&gt;</description>

At one point he says, "I do entertain the idea that we may each have our own Timewave, sort of following the model of astrology." ... Then near the end of this session we hear him say, "The whole thing [Timewave hypothesis] smacks of the impossible. It's even pushed me toward the idea that maybe this is not actually a reality. We're trapped, or I'm trapped. I don't know if you're trapped. But we're in some kind of piece of fiction. It's like a Phillip K. Dick deal, you know. We're in some kind of simulacrum, and the clue to the fact that it's a simulacrum is this impossible idea [the Timewave]. And so the point of the idea is not to believe it, but to use it as a wedge to fight our way out of this labyrinth and back to whatever reality we were in before we fell into this situation.

      <description>In part four of the Terence McKenna workshop about imagination he discusses the ego, Novelty Theory, and the possibility that time is not uniform. As he says, "The Timewave is not occult, but it is not science as we have done it these past 500 years, because it assumes that one of our primary intuitions is actually true; the intuition that every moment is unique [time is not uniform]. It treats that as the central starting point for an entirely new metaphysics of being." ... "The way you investigate time is by moving inward, by investigating metabolism. The human body is a knot in time." ... Also included is part of a conversation with Allan Lundell, Nick Herbert and few friends.&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/matrixmasters/iGAG/~4/z4GTyDuPM1g" height="1" width="1"/&gt;</description>

      <description>In this third podcast of Terence McKenna's workshop on imagination, he picks up the pace and speaks to a dozen or more new topics. Not only does he explain what he calls 'McKenna's Five Percent Rule', he also gives us McKenna's Law:  "As you advance in social hierarchy the percentage of smart people does not increase. ... Every human situation is bedeviled by morons. No matter how high you rise you're surrounded by fools, and you're lucky if you're not one of them. That's the basic thing to guard against."

Every human situation is bedeviled by morons. No matter how high you rise you're surrounded by fools, and you're lucky if you're not one of them. That's the basic thing to guard against."

      <description>Among many other provocative ideas found in this talk is: "The major adventure is to claim your authentic, true being, which is not culturally given to you. The culture will not explain to you how to be a real human being. It will tell you how to be banker, politician, Indian chief, masseuses, actress, whatever, but it will not give you true being." ...

While he has some interesting thoughts about imagination such as, "Art is like the footprint of where the imagination has been." It was his thought about computers that most people may take away from this first part of the workshop where he also says, "The only difference between computers and drugs is that one is too large to swallow ... and our best people are working on that very problem."&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/matrixmasters/iGAG/~4/YSAI31gHexE" height="1" width="1"/&gt;</description>

So in this program you will hear from Gary Fisher, Sasha Shulgin, Ann Shulgin, Myron Stolaroff, Terence McKenna, Baba Ram Das, and Timothy Leary in a medley of ideas that hopefully will inspire you to strive to become an elder yourself.&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/matrixmasters/iGAG/~4/K-Kl3J2DLh4" height="1" width="1"/&gt;</description>

And then he went on to say: "You, the younger generation in particular, have got to drop out, and by drop out I mean all the way. You can't vote, I urge you not to do politics, don't picket, don't get involved in any of these menopausal mind games because it doesn't make any difference."&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/matrixmasters/iGAG/~4/znLDyIg0rGg" height="1" width="1"/&gt;</description>

In any event, here is the Bard McKenna holding forth on the importance of keeping Nature as a focus in our lives. And as always, he has many provocative ideas such as, "Psychedelics are illegal not because a loving government is concerned that you may jump out of a third story window. Psychedelics are illegal because they dissolve opinion structures and culturally laid down models of behavior and information processing. They open you up to the possibility that everything you know is wrong."&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/matrixmasters/iGAG/~4/-dqQTjs5Coo" height="1" width="1"/&gt;</description>

      <description>In this 1968 lecture at the University of Notre Dame, Dr. Timothy Leary gives the then all-male student body a lesson in alternative thought. Basically, he told them that almost everything they are being taught is tainted with illogic. However, he also said that on the whole he didn't think that most of them were ready to use psychedelics  yet, that the experience might be too powerful for them. Among other provocative things that the good doctor had to tell the young Catholic lads was, "Dope is going to be the religion of the future." One can only imagine (with a big smile) how discussions in the religious classrooms on campus went down the next day.&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/matrixmasters/iGAG/~4/axDuMhmgQ8I" height="1" width="1"/&gt;</description>

      <description>In today's podcast we join Alan Watts, Timothy Leary, Allen Ginsberg, and Gary Snyder for an hour-and-a-half of a conversation held on Watts' houseboat in February of 1967, just a few weeks after the first Human Be-In. While there are any number of interesting tidbits and some fascinating similarities to what is taking place in the world again today, one of the most interesting parts (at least to me) of their conversation is what must have been their first discussion of Dr. Leary's famous, but spontaneous proclamation of, "Turn on, tune in, drop out". If you are a student of Dr. Leary, this is a conversation you won't want to miss. . . . And did I mention that the real star of this show is Alan Watts, who said among other things: "In other words, when there is a game going on that's on a collision course, and that this game obviously is going to lead to total destruction, the only way of getting people out of a bad game is to indicate that the game is no longer interesting. See, we've left this game and it bores us."&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/matrixmasters/iGAG/~4/SOyxMj17uIU" height="1" width="1"/&gt;</description>

      <description>This brings to a conclusion the series of recordings from a Terence McKenna workshop that he led over the weekend of November 5-7, 1988 at the California Institute of Integral Studies (CIIS). One of the more fascinating questions that he answers is, "How do you remember to bring back what you've learned?" And his answer, dealing with state-bounded memory, is something I hadn't thought of before.



And like the preivous four programs in this series, Terence again peppers this one with provocative thoughts such as, "This is in fact what shamanism is all about, what the end of history is all about, what psychedelic drugs are all about, we are edge-walking on an ontological transformation of what it means to be human."&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/matrixmasters/iGAG/~4/v7LtDlPkNa0" height="1" width="1"/&gt;</description>

One of his more controversial comments this week may be: "The psychedelic experience is the beginning of the spiritual path. That's why it's not important that yogas claim that they can deliver you the psychedelic experience, because it begins with the psychedelic experience, and then you go from there."&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/matrixmasters/iGAG/~4/owTMIyc9oc4" height="1" width="1"/&gt;</description>

      <description>We continue with a Terence McKenna workshop recorded on the first weekend of November in 1988. The workshop was conducted at the California Institute of Integral Studies in San Francisco. One of the more interesting segments of this talk is that it is one of his clearest public statements regarding the relative merits of natural psychedelics vs. synthetic ones. And his opinion on November 6, 1988 was, "I really think there is a very large distinction between synthetic and naturally occurring drugs." ... He also goes on to say, "I have never felt that the primary use of these things [psychedelic medicines] was to cure what is called in modern parlance neurosis, what I call unhappiness. It isn't for that."&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/matrixmasters/iGAG/~4/ltsxw6mFOdI" height="1" width="1"/&gt;</description>

And then he goes on to briefly describe his years of travel while posing as a butterfly collector, eventually leading him to the Amazon. He then goes on to give his 1988 version of what he thought the psychedelic experience actually was, and he reads the titles of some of his favorite books.

      <description>Today's podcast features Bruce Damer, first at a Mind States conference in Oaxaca, Mexico and then in a late night conversation with Lorenzo. Among other things, Bruce talks about the team he led that developed some of the Virtual Reality simulations NASA used in training the astronaughts who recently repaired the Hubble telescope. ... However, the primary focus of Bruce's remarks may be summed up when he said, "If you want a future, you have to take charge of your own thoughts."&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/matrixmasters/iGAG/~4/JXdTorcFBrk" height="1" width="1"/&gt;</description>

The first is a radio interview of Dr. Leary, and it is followed by an interview with Robert Anton Wilson for the same program a couple of days later. The last piece is the beginning of a talk that Timothy Leary gave at Cornell in 1984. In it, among the many other things Leary has to say is, "I have one cause, and that's the goal of the performing philosopher, is to encourage you, and inspire you, and empower you, to the extent I can, to Think for Yourself and Question Authority."&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/matrixmasters/iGAG/~4/2U3fV5Rrmis" height="1" width="1"/&gt;</description>

      <description>From 1980 to 1985, Dr. George Greer and his wife/Nurse-assistant, Requa Tolbert administered MDMA over 100 times to 80 people as part of his clinical psychiatric practice.

If you think you know everyting there is to know about anarchism, you owe it to yourself to hear Dale's talk about this interesting new approach. One of my favorite soundbites is "Isolation is one of the keys of state power.

So it is very important for us to get together and have fun."</itunes:summary><itunes:keywords>consciousness,psychedelic,entheogen,culture,McKenna,LSD,psilocybin,cannabis,marijuana</itunes:keywords><link>http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/matrixmasters/iGAG/~3/w8_sI4rFIxs/055-DalePendell-PalenqueNorte2006.mp3</link><feedburner:origLink>http://www.matrixmasters.net/archive/DalePendell/055-DalePendell-PalenqueNorte2006.mp3</feedburner:origLink><enclosure url="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/matrixmasters/iGAG/~5/w8_sI4rFIxs/055-DalePendell-PalenqueNorte2006.mp3" length="17200000" type="text/audio" /><feedburner:origEnclosureLink>http://www.matrixmasters.net/archive/DalePendell/055-DalePendell-PalenqueNorte2006.mp3</feedburner:origEnclosureLink></item>

      <description>In his 2006 Palenque Norte lecture at Burning Man, Nick Sand explains how best to use some of the more interesting combinations of sacred medicines. Additionally he answered a wide range of questions that included such diverse topics as the relationship of the atomic bomb to LSD and the reasons he left the quiet life of academia to create Orange Sunshine, which was considered to be some of the best acid available in the 1960s.&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/matrixmasters/iGAG/~4/ubXBcxat68c" height="1" width="1"/&gt;</description>

      <description>Fraser Clark returns to the Psychedelic Salon with a brilliant talk he gave as a guest lecturer at Stanford University. In his introduction to this podcast, Lorenzo calls this one of the most important programs we have heard so far in this series.



In this talk you're going to hear one off the most concise explanations of the evolution from beat to hippy to zippy to raver that you're probably ever going to hear.Adopting the philosophy of the rave culture, at least the way Fraser explains it in this talk, is perhaps our species' best hope for a sustainable, peaceful, and beautiful place to continue chugging along on our evolutionary path.&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/matrixmasters/iGAG/~4/TdzGd1VVcJw" height="1" width="1"/&gt;</description>
