  <h1>Fanscribed Transcription Engine (FTE)</h1>

  <p>
    Fanscribed Transcription Engine (FTE) is a unique way to
    manage all aspects of creating an accurate written transcript
    of recorded speech using crowdsourced human workers.
  </p>

  <p>
    FTE differs from wiki-style crowdsourced transcription
    (as used by the
    <a href="https://github.com/fanscribed/fanscribed/">Classic Fanscribed</a>
    open source project):
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>A quality-control process leads to very accurate transcripts.</li>
    <li>Task isolation allows casual volunteers to help without requiring deep knowledge (such as speaker names).</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    FTE differs from traditional single-person transcription:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Tedium is relieved by time-boxing each transcription task, and varying the types of work.</li>
    <li>The quality-control process can be spread throughout a group, leading to higher accuracy.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>How FTE Works</h2>

  <p>
    The transcript is first split into segments, usually 10 seconds in length.
    Then, the transcript goes through five stages, each broken into many individual tasks:
  </p>

  <ol>
    <li><strong>Transcribe</strong>: In each segment, every spoken sentence or sentence fragment is transcribed to text.</li>
    <li><strong>Stitch</strong>: At the edges of each fragment, sentence fragments are bound together into complete sentences.</li>
    <li><strong>Boundary</strong>: The precise time code for each sentence is found.</li>
    <li><strong>Clean</strong>: Capitalization, punctuation, repetition, and other errors are corrected.</li>
    <li><strong>Speaker</strong>: The speaker of each sentence is identified.</li>
  </ol>

  <p>
    After each task, another person is given that task to review it,
    and make any needed changes.
  </p>

  <p>
    Once all stages are completed, you have an accurate,
    time-coded transcript!
