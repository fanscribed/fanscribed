            <h4>Help Transcribe</h4>
            <p>
              You might think transcribing audio to text would be boring.
              It can be, but only if you use the wrong tools.
            </p>
            <p>
              Fanscribed makes it fun to transcribe!
              You're in control,
              and each task takes less than two minutes to complete.
              We mix things up so you don't get bored, and
              you can start and stop any time.
            </p>
            <p>
              Transcription is currently volunteer work,
              but we're working to create a marketplace
              so you can earn money for helping with sponsored transcripts.
            </p>

            <h4>Become a Patron</h4>
            <p>
              There will always be a place for volunteer work,
              but some podcasters or fans like to
              reward people for their efforts.
            </p>
            <p>
              To help with that,
              Fanscribed will be introducing a marketplace.
              Patrons will pay toward completed transcripts.
              Transcribers will receive money based on their share of work done.
            </p>
